## Question

What is anthropology? 

## Evidence

Anthropology can be defined with a phrase: 

> Making the familiar strange and the strange familiar. 

*Culture*: A way of thinking/living/being

Culture is always changing. What was normal today might not be normal in a few years. We investigate how today's "normal" came to be and why it's so prevalent today. 

Anthropologists take people's practices seriously; in other words, we don't think other practices or people as "exotic". Instead, we consider people and their practices on their own terms; this is called *cultural relativism*. 

## Conclusion

Anthropology is a field of study that seeks to understand culture in its entirety; why it changes to what it is today, its origins, its applications to real-world events, and our perspectives of it.
