## Chapter 1: Logic

*Proposition*: A statement that is either true or false, but not both. 

* "Tomorrow is Friday." This proposition is false, since today is Wednesday. 
* "Go Badgers!" This is not a proposition, since we can't say for certain if this statement is true or false. 
* "Jun Le is wearing jeans." This proposition is true. 
* "Jun Le has exactly $1 in his pocket." Even though we don't know if this is true or false, that are the only two options for this situation. Therefore, this is a proposition.
