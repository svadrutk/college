Both of the readings discuss racism in the medical field; one article focuses on how an algorithm designed to calculate health risks is biased towards colored people, and the other article focuses on biased medical grant-giving based on race. Algorithms are often biased because the people working on them aren't diverse enough. In the case of artificial intelligence, a homogeneous group of people working on the AI directly correlates with an AI that is biased towards the workers' races. Additionally, in the case of the other algorithm that determines whether medical workers get a grant, a study showed that "applications from African-American and Asian-American women were less likely to receive R01 awards.", showing that the actions of women of color are seen as less commendable than white people.
