# QCC 7 

In this week's readings, we explore privacy and arguments for and against privacy. In Solove's "Why Privacy Matters Nothing to Hide", he explores the age-old argument for privacy -- that is, the 'nothing to hide' argument. It is "an argument that the privacy interest is generally minimal, thus making the contest with security concerns a foreordained victory for security.". In another New York Times article, Hill explores a secretive company, Clearview AI, and what their inventions (advanced facial recognition software) mean for the privacy of citizens from governments. I found it interesting that most influential Silicon Valley companies refrained from releasing such software because they were worried about what it could do -- for example, Google's chairman stated that the reason they didn't release the software was "because it could be used 'in a very bad way.'.". I wonder if they said this because releasing such a controversial software could be detrimental to their profits, or if they actually felt that it was morally wrong.
