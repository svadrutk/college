This article, written by Sara Morrison, explores the "true cost" of Amazon's own products on their store. Morrison mentions that Amazon has recently dealing with multiple efforts to curb their power on the world stage, such as a recent antitrust bill (one of several) and another FTC antitrust investigation on AWS. 

Morrison discusses how much power Amazon has in the economy, such as its multifaceted business. Amazon is a technology company, delivery service, cloud platform that powers approximately a third of the Internet, and much more. These antitrust laws are attempting to give a chance for other businesses to level the playing field. 

Morrison concludes grimly; Amazon businesses are growing exponentially, and are even seeking to take on threats like Shopify.
