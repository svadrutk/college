One point I am challenging in the report is the panel's response to the question, "How has public sentiment toward AI evolved, and how should we inform/educate the public?". The panel says that "given the historical boom/bust pattern in public support for AI, it is important that the AI community not overhype specific approaches or products and create unrealistic expectations."(35). I mostly agree with this, but I feel like hyping the right AI developments up will give more public awareness to AI. For example, the new OpenAI development, ChatGPT, gained a million users in the first five days thanks to viral Tiktoks that showcased its capabilities (TikTok). As a result, much more teens and young adults are learning about the potential capabilities of artificial intelligence. 

Another point I am challenging is the panel's response to the question, "What are the most pressing challenges and significant opportunities in the use of artificial intelligence to provide physical and emotional care to people in need?" (67). The panel says that autonomous systems should not replace human-care relationships, saying that "companion robots will not replace the human decision-makers who increase a patient's comfort through intimate knowledge of their conditions and needs." (68). I think this is an invalid argument, as most artificial intelligence have become smarter than humans and when given a list of patient's needs, will accomplish much faster and more efficiently than a human caregiver. An article in Science magazine says that AI has learned to reason like humans, saying that neural nets can act like neurons and "stitch together tiny programs that collaboratively find patterns in data". Since AI can reason like humans as well as compute calculations billions of times faster than a human brain, it would be safe to say that an artificial intelligence would be much better at taking care of patients than a human would. 

One of the points made in the report is that AI is being used effectively across various industries. This is partially true, as AI has indeed made its way into various industries and has revolutionized certain aspects of business operations. However, it is important to note that not all AI applications have been successful, and in some cases, AI has caused more problems than it has solved. For example, AI systems used in medical imaging have been known to produce inaccurate results, causing harm to patients. Additionally, the implementation of AI systems in the workplace has led to job losses, and its impact on employment has yet to be fully understood.

Finally, the report claims that AI systems have become more reliable and secure. While AI systems have indeed become more reliable, their security is still a major concern. AI systems are vulnerable to attacks, and their use of sensitive data makes them a prime target for malicious actors. Additionally, the complexity of AI systems makes it difficult to detect and prevent security breaches, making them a potential threat to the privacy and security of individuals and organizations.
