Situation: During my internship at SkyWater Technology Foundry, I was tasked with improving semiconductor wafer viability testing algorithms to enhance global testing efficiency.

Task: My responsibility was to redesign the algorithms in C, which included developing a wafer parser and a die test site selector. Additionally, I was required to design selection algorithms to uniformly choose different parts of the die based on specific criteria such as radius and the number of sites required.

Action: To accomplish this task, I thoroughly researched the existing algorithms and understood the intricacies of semiconductor wafer testing. I then implemented a new approach by developing robust selection algorithms that could accurately and efficiently choose the test sites on the wafer. I collaborated closely with the team, utilizing my programming skills and understanding of fab processes like lithography, etching, and wafer testing. Additionally, I adopted OCAPs (Out-of-Control Action Plans) to track project progress meticulously. This allowed me to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement, enabling me to refine the algorithms iteratively.

Result: As a result of these efforts, the redesigned algorithms led to a significant 4% increase in global testing efficiency. The new selection algorithms ensured a uniform and precise selection of different parts of the die, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the testing process. By utilizing OCAPs, we not only tracked our progress effectively but also identified areas for continuous improvement in manufacturing processes, contributing to overall project success.
