# CS240: Lec 003

Good proofs have seven characteristics: 

* Correct
* Complete
* Clear
* Brief
* Elegant -- or clever
* Well organized
* In order

You should not use these types of proofs: 

* Proof by throwing in the kitchen sink -- e.g. writing every theorem ever
* Proof by example -- e.g. proving something by saying it works for one case, like $n = 2$ 
* Proof by vigorous hand-waving (??? WHO DOES THIS WTF)
* Proof by cumbersome notation  -- e.g. using the weirdest symbols ever in your equations without defining what they mean
* Proof by exhaustion 
* Proof by omission -- e.g. saying that other cases are trivial, or the reader can provide the details
* Proof by picture -- see Lecture 2
* Proof by vehement assertion
* Proof by appeal to intuition -- e.g. saying everybody knows that 
* Proof by authority -- some authority says a proof is true, therefore it must be true
