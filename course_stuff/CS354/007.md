## Stack

When you start a program, you are given a bunch of memory addresses to use. Address `x0000` is reserved for null pointers and such. 

The code appears in the addresses right after `x0000`. The data appears after that, such as strings. Next the heap stores dynamically allocated memory (e.g. chunks of memory that I will use for myself.) Finally, the stack holds local variables, return addresses, return values, and parameters. There is a maximum stack size, and it isn't very big; the heap is better for storing big data structures. 

The `main()` is pushed onto the stack first, and then other functions defined in the code. Each of these little blocks of code is called a *stack frame*. It is made up of four (five?) things: 

* *Return address*: The instruction that we jump back to; e.g. a line in `main()` that calls the function 
* *Return value*: Whatever value the function returns, be it an integer or a string. 
* *Parameters*: Parameters defined in the function. 
* *Local Variables*: Local variables defined in the function 
* *Stack pointer*: A register that stores the address of the last program request; e.g. to access `int i` in a `for` loop. 

When a program ends (returns), its stack frame is removed from a stack, all the way up till `main` ends. 

```c
// REVERSE
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void print_array(int *a); 
int * reverse(int a[]); 

int main() {
    int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}; 
    print_array(a); 
    int *p = reverse(a); 
    print_array(p); 
    free(p); // free the memory from the pointer after using it
    return 0; 
}

void print_array(int *a) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", a[i]); 
    }
    printf("\n"); 
}
// bad version
int * reverse(int[] a) {
    int r[5]; 
    int i = 0, j = 4; 
    while(i < 5) {
        r[i++] = a[j--];
    }
    return r; // this implementation doesn't work since r is erased from the stack after the while loop. 
}
// good version 
int * reverse(int a[]) { 
    int *r = malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // malloc is a function ensures the data is stored on the heap rather than the stack.
    int i = 0, j = 4; 
    while(i < 5) {
        r[i++] = a[j--]; 
    }
    return r; 
}
```
