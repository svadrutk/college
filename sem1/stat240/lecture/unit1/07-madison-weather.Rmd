# Madison Weather Overview

- We will be working with data set containing weather data on Madison collect over a number of years from  different weather stations.
- In addition to investigating different scientific questions on the data, we will also be learning about the [`dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) from `tidyverse` which is "a grammar of data manipulation."  

## Overview of Madison Weather Data

> The source of the data for this week is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States.

- See [CNCS Chapter 7](https://bookdown.org/bret_larget/stat-240-case-studies/madison-weather.html) for more information.
- The data set described here includes data through December 31, 2020.

- The data file is `madison-weather-2020.csv`, and the variable descriptions are provided below.

STATION: unique code for the weather station   
NAME: station name    
LATITUDE: station latitude  
LONGITUDE: station longitude  
ELEVATION: station elevation (feet above sea level)   
DATE: date of observations  
AWND: average wind speed (mph)  
PRCP: precipitation (inches, water)  
SNOW: snow fall (inches)  
SNWD: snow depth (inches)  
TAVG: daily average air temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)   
TMAX: maximum air temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)   
TMIN: minimum air temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)   
WSF1: maximum one-minute wind speed  

### Import Data

- The data file has one row for each date and weather station.
- The following block of code will read in the data.
    - We specify the types of data in each column.
    - This prevents an error where some variables with many initial rows of contain missing data and are set to be logical instead of numeric.
    
```{r}
## Read in the data
## Specify the type
## This is needed to avoid issues for columns where first 1000 rows are all missing
##   and the type is set to logical

mw_original = read_csv("../../data/madison-weather-2020.csv",
              col_types = cols(
  STATION = col_character(),
  NAME = col_character(),
  LATITUDE = col_double(),
  LONGITUDE = col_double(),
  ELEVATION = col_double(),
  DATE = col_date(format = ""),
  PRCP = col_double(),
  SNOW = col_double(),
  SNWD = col_double(),
  TAVG = col_double(),
  TMAX = col_double(),
  TMIN = col_double()))

dim(mw_original)

head(mw_original)
```

## Transform Data

- I do not like using all capital letters for the variable names.
    - Let's change names using the `rename()` function.
- We will save the changed data in an object named `mw`.    

```{r}
## rename the variables
mw = mw_original %>%
  rename(station = STATION,
         name = NAME,
         latitude = LATITUDE,
         longitude = LONGITUDE,
         elevation = ELEVATION,
         date = DATE,
         prcp = PRCP,
         snow = SNOW,
         snow_depth = SNWD,
         tavg = TAVG,
         tmax = TMAX,
         tmin = TMIN)
```

- The values in the `name` variable are long and unwieldly.
- Change them using the `recode()` function inside of `mutate()`
    - We use `mutate()` to create new variables or modify existing variables
    - `recode()` is different than most **tidyverse** variables which change values
    - Most use the idiom `new = old`, but `recode()` is backwards.
    - This is an oddity of the language you just need to remember (or look up when there is an unexpected error).

```{r}
mw = mw %>% 
  mutate(name = recode(name,
                       `UW ARBORETUM MADISON, WI US` = "Arboretum",
                       `CHARMANY FARM, WI US` = "Charmany",
                       `MADISON DANE CO REGIONAL AIRPORT, WI US` = "Airport",
                       `MADISON WEATHER BUREAU CITY, WI US` = "Bureau"))
```

## Weather Stations

- Some of the variables refer to the weather stations and do not change.
- Let's make a summary with one row per weather station where we can specify:
    - The station code
    - The earliest date included
    - The latest date included
    - The number of dates included in the data set
    - The number of dates that are missing
- Here is the strategy:
    - use `group_by()` to do the calculations for each weather station separately
    - compare the total number of possible dates from the earliest to latest dates with the actual number of values for each
    
```{r}
stations = mw %>% 
  select(station, name, latitude, longitude, elevation, date) %>% 
  group_by(station, name, latitude, longitude, elevation) %>% 
  summarize(first_date = min(date),
            last_date = max(date),
            n = n(),
            possible = as.numeric(last_date - first_date) + 1,
            missing = possible - n)
stations
```
    
- The official weather station was the Madison Weather Bureau from January 1, 1869 until September 30, 1939 and then the Airport from October 1, 1939 to the present.
- The weather stations at the Arboretum and Charmany Farms have a great deal of missing data.
- We will modify the `mw` data set by:
    - eliminating the station-specific variables
    - eliminating observations from the Arboretum and Charmany Farms
    - arranging by date
- We can create an official Madison weather data set with one observation per date

```{r}
mw = mw %>%
  select(name, date, prcp, snow, snow_depth, tmin, tmax, tavg) %>% 
  filter(name == "Airport" | name == "Bureau") %>%
  arrange(date, name)

official = mw %>% 
  filter(name == "Airport" | (name == "Bureau" & date < ymd("1939-10-01")))
```

- Let's redo the missing data calculations for the official data

```{r}
official_stations = official %>% 
  select(name, date) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(first_date = min(date),
            last_date = max(date),
            n = n(),
            possible = as.numeric(last_date - first_date) + 1,
            missing = possible - n)
official_stations
```

- The official record is missing just seven days.
- We will explore this next.

## Missing Data

- There are seven missing dates in the official records.
- In addition, there may be some missing data among the precipation and temperature data.
- We will first add in the missing dates with missing data for all variables
- Then, we will count missing data in each column of data.

- To add missing dates, we will create a data frame with all dates from January 1, 1869 through September 30, 1939, and then join it to the official weather data set.

```{r}
## Create a temporary data file
temp = tibble(
  date = seq(ymd("1869-01-01"),ymd("1939-09-30"), 1),
  name = "Bureau")

## join with the official data set
## show this adds the seven missing dates
nrow(official)

official = official %>% 
  full_join(temp)

## Note there are now seven more dates added
nrow(official)

## Eliminate the temporary data set
rm(temp)
```

- Next, count the missing observations in each variable
- We create a function to count missing observations.
- We cannot use comparisons such as `==` to compare with `NA`.
- Instead, use `is.na()`.
- We will learn more about writing functions later in the course.

```{r}
count_na = function(x)
{
  return( sum(is.na(x)) )
}
  
```

- Do the summary of missing data

```{r}
official_summary = official %>% 
  summarize(prcp_na = count_na(prcp),
            snow_na = count_na(snow),
            depth_na = count_na(snow_depth),
            tmax_na = count_na(tmax),
            tmin_na = count_na(tmin),
            tavg_na = count_na(tavg))

official_summary
```

- There is a lot of missing data for average temperatures.
- We can recalculate these as the average of the `tmax` and `tmin` variables.
- There is minimal missing data for precipitation or maximum or minimum temperatures.
    - Summaries of these variables after dropping missing data are not likely to be too inaccurate
- Snow and snow depth data has a fair amount missing.
    - Much of this is because the data was not recorded at the beginning of the collection period.
    
```{r}
official %>% 
  select(name, date, snow) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(first_snow = min(date))

official %>% 
  select(name, date, snow_depth) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(first_snow = min(date))
```
    
- If we analyze the snow data, we will need to use a different time range.
- Also, some NA snow totals in the summer or when precipitation is zero may really be zero and not missing.

## Repair average temperature

```{r}
official = official %>% 
  mutate(tavg = (tmin + tmax) / 2)
```

## Write files

- It will be helpful to write the modified official weather data into a file so that we do not need to redo the data transformations each time

```{r}
write_csv(official, "../../data/madison-weather-official-2020.csv")
```
