## Discussion 1

### The week of September 13--17, 2021
#### 11:59pm 24 hours after your discussion section meets

### Preliminaries

Edit the YAML section of this document and change `REPLACE_THIS_TEXT_WITH_YOUR_NAME` with your name.

Then, follow the instructions in the Course Notes to set up your computer:

[https://bookdown.org/bret_larget/stat-240-case-studies/prerequisites.html](https://bookdown.org/bret_larget/stat-240-case-studies/prerequisites.html)

If you have not already done so:

- move this file (`disc01.Rmd`) into the directory `COURSE/discussion/disc01`

### Problems

#### 1.

The following chunk of code will test if R is installed.

```{r}
set.seed(2021)
rpois(1, 25)
```

The output will be the characters `[1]` followed by a number. What is the number?

24

#### 2.

The next block of code tests if you have installed the tidyverse properly.
 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data(trees)
summarize(trees, n=n(), average=mean(Height))
```

The output will be a table that indicates the number of rows (n) of the data set `trees` and the average of the variable `Height`. What is the average of the variable `Height`, listed under the word **average** in the output?

76

#### 3.

Make sure that the current file is in the directory `COURSE/discussion/disc01`.

**Set this as your working directory.**

The following code chunk should list the names of the files and directories two levels up, which should be the (mostly empty) sub-directories you created.
If this is not what you see in the knitted HTML document,
then verify that your directory structure is correct and that this file is in the correct location.

```{r}
as.data.frame( list.dirs(path = "../..", recursive = FALSE) )
```

#### 4.

Verify that you can read in a data file

The next code chunk reads in the Lake Mendota data, prints the variable names, and prints the dimensions of the data set.

```{r}
## read the data
mendota = read_csv("../data/lake-mendota-winters-2021.csv")

## print variable names
names(mendota)

## dimensions
dim(mendota)
```

What is the name of the first variable in the data set?

winter

How many rows are in the data set?

166

### Submission

After completing the assignment,
click on the Knit icon to knit to HTML.
This action will create a file named `disc01.html` in the directory `COURSE/discussion/disc01`.
This is the file you should upload to complete your assignment.

To submit this assignment, go to our Canvas site and select "Assignments" on the left panel.
Follow directions to upload the HTML file.

*Note: do not upload the .Rmd file. Also, if you knitted to PDF or Word instead of HTML, click the small down arrow to the right of the `Knit` icon and select `Knit to HTML`*
