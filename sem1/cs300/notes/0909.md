# 09/09: Arrays in Java

* Arrays are **reference types**, start at 0, and an element in an array can be accessed by the index of said element

```java
int[] data = {10,20,30,40}; 
// You can also call it like this: 
int[] data;
data = new int[]{10,20,30,40}
System.out.println(data[0]); // outputs 10
```

**LOOK UP WHAT STACKS AND HEAPS ARE**

* A perfect-size array is only defined by its reference; it has a set size

```java
int[] data = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5}; 
// or 
String[] values = new String[]{"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", null, "X", null, "Z"}
```

* Oversize arrays are defined by two parameters
  * Reference
  * `int` variable to keep track of the array size

* Size of an oversize array $\leq$ Capacity
* Elements stored in oversize array are in a range of indexes `[0..size-1]`
