**RECAP ON FUNCTIONS:**

* To give a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is to give a rule which assigns to each element in $X$ and element in $Y$. 
* The pre-image of a subset $Z \subseteq Y$ is the subset of the domain $X$ defined by 

$$
f^{-1}(Z) = \{x \in X|f(x) \in Z\}
$$

* The pre-image of an element $y \in Y$ is the set of all elements $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$. 
* The image of $f$ is the subset of all elements $y \in Y$ such that $f(x) = y$ for some $x \in X$. 
* A matrix function, or a matrix transformation, $f: \R^m \rightarrow \R^n$ is a function given by $f(\vec{x}) = A\vec{x}$ for some $m \cross n$ matrix $A$. 

**EXAMPLE PROBLEM**

Consider the matrix transformation $f(x) = Ax$ defined by the matrix
$$
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 5 \\ 
4 & 10
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Is the matrix invertible? 

A 2x2 matrix is only invertible when the determinant does not equal 0. In this case, it does, so $\fbox{the matrix is not invertible.}$ 

---

Are the following vectors in the image? If so, what are the pre-images? 
$$
b_1 = \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 6\end{bmatrix}, b_2 = \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 6\end{bmatrix}, b_3 = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}
$$
Asking whether $b_1 \in im(f)$ amounts to solving $Ax = b$. If the solution exists, $b_1$ lies in the image => we call the set of solutions the pre-image of $b_1$; else, it's not. 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 5 \\
4 & 10
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\ 
x_2
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 
6
\end{bmatrix}
$$
There is no solution because if you run the elimination method (by converting to a system of equations) you get a DNE. Therefore, $b_1 \notin im(f)$ 

What about $b_2$ ?

Converting directly to a system of equations: 
$$
2x + 3y = 3 \\ 
4x + 10y = 6
$$
There are infinitely many solutions. Therefore, $x + 2.5y = 6$. The preimage of $b_2$ is $x+1.5y = 1.5$.
