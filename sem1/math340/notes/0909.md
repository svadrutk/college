**PROBLEM 1**

Given the linear system 
$$
x+2y = 8 \\
3x-4y = 8
$$

1. Draw the lines in the $xy$-plane

2. Use the picture in (a) to answer "is the system consistent? How many solutions does it have?"

   The system is consistent; it has one solution. 

3. Solve the system. 

$$
\fbox{(4.8,1.6)}
$$



**PROBLEM 2**
$$
x-5y = 6 \\
3x+2y = 1 \\
5x+2y = 1
$$

The system is not consistent; there are no solutions. 

**PROBLEM 3**
$$
3x+4y-z = 8 \\
6x + 8y-2z = 3
$$
This system is inconsistent; there are no solutions.

**PROBLEM 4** 
$$
2x + 3y - z = 6 \\
2x - y + 2z = =-8 \\ 
3x - y + z = -7
$$
Eliminate $x$ in all but the first equation: 
$$
2x+ 3y - z = 6 \\ 
-4y + 3z = -14 \\ 
-11y + 5z = -32 \\ 
$$
Eliminate $y$ in the third equation: 
$$
2x +3y - z = 6 \\ 
-4y + 3z = -14 \\ 
-13z = 26
$$

$$
\fbox{$z = -2, y = 2,x = -1$}
