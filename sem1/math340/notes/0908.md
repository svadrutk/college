* Systems of linear equations is the origin of linear algebra 
* Matrices are used to study the above, but you can also study them on your own
* Linear transformations help to understand matrices in a more complex manner
  * We will use tools to study linear transformations better

---

* **LINEAR EQUATIONS**: Equations that only include sums of constants and scalar multiples 
  * Scalar = number

$$
3x+5y = 18
$$

* $3$ scales the variable $x$
* Any equations with higher degree variables; e.g. $x^4$ is not a linear equation

**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 1**
$$
x+2y+3z=6 \\
2x-3y+2z = 14 \\
3x+y - z = -2
$$
You can solve this by eliminating the 1st variable in everything but the 1st equation, then eliminate the 2nd variable in all but the first 2 equations, etc. 
$$
x + 2y + 3z = 6 \\
-7y - 4z = 2 \\ 
-5y-10z = -20
$$
which changes to 
$$
x + 2y + 3z= 6 \\
7y+4z = -2 \\
50z = 150
$$
Therefore, $z = 3$. 

After that you can just substitute $z$ into the second equation to find $y$, and then substitute both of those into the first equation to find $x$. 

Therefore, 
$$
\fbox{$z=3, y=-2,x=1$}
$$

* A system of linear equations is consistent if it has one solution
  * SLEs can also have infinitely many solutions
  * No solutions => inconsistent

**EXAMPLE PROBLEM 2** 

If I have two linear equations in $x,y,z$, what are the possibilities for the solution set? 

The solution set can be a line (if there's one solution), a plane (when there's infinitely many solutions), or an empty set (when there's no solutions)
