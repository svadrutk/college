I have until Wednesday to study for this exam. I also have to study for a cs252 exam, but that isn't as important, since I can take it until Friday. THIS IS THE PRIORITY. 

## 09/31 -- Friday 
I'm free after 5:00. I can construct all of my mega-problem sets today; the graded problem sets, coupled with the discussion questions, coupled with some technical questions, coupled with some sample problems from each of the lectures. I will split this by week, so I will have about 4/5 mega-problem sets. I'll figure out exactly how many tomorrow. 

## 10/01 -- Saturday
I'm free all day today. I'll wake up at 9AM and try to grind through half of the problem sets, usinng the quiz and recall method.

## 10/02 -- Sunday
The majority of my day is taken up by Rheta's, but I can work a little bit before and a little bit after. I will (try?) to grind through the other half, but I'm not expecting much -- anyway, I have most of Monday to finish up. Not a big deal 

## 10/03 -- Monday
I should aim to be completely done with reviewing the problem sets by today. If there's a practice exam available, I should try to take it with the time constraints and see how I do.
