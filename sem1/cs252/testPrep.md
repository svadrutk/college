This is probably the class that I'm having the most trouble with -- stat240 is just memorizing a shit ton of syntax and the exam is like a month away. DONT THINK ABOUT THIS.

I have already made a semi-mega problem set, which is just a combination of all the homework problems in different order. Please make sure to actually do this with annotation. Understand every step.

Honestly, I don't know how else to study for this since that's the only problems he gave and a lot of people said the exam was nearly identical to the homework.
