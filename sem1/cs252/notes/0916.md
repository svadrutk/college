There is a shortcut for determining negatives. 

* Sum 0 bits (instead of 1) if the sign bit is 1 
* Add 1 to determine the negative value

How to convert `base 10 => base 2`

1. If number is negative, change it to a positive decimal number
2. Subtract largest power of two less than or equal to the number and put a 1 in the corresponding bit position
3. Repeat previous until result is zero 
4. Add a zero as the leading bit
5. If original was nega
6. killtive, negate (or take the two's complement)

**EXAMPLE**

What is the base 2 two's complement value of 17? (USE 6 BITS)

1. SKIP33
2. `-16 - 1 => 10001`
3. `10001 => 010001`
4. SKIP

What is the base 2 two's complement value of -7? (USE 6 BITS)

1. `-7 => 7` 
2. `7 - 4 - 2 - 1 => 00111`
3. `00111 => 000111`
4. Take the two's complement

```
000111 => 111001
```

Two's complement binary addition is just like decimal addition. 

* Start from least significant digit
* Add digits in corresponding positions
* Propagate carry-out values to the next position on the left

**EXAMPLE** 

Add the following 6-bit two's complement integers

1. `010010 + 000101` 

   `=> 18 + 5 = 23` So I should see 23 as a solution 

   ```
   010010
   000101
   ------
   010111 => 1 + 2 + 4 + 16 = 23 ✔
   ```

2. `001111 + 000001`

   `=> 15 + 1 = 16`

   ```
   001111 
   000001
   ------
   010000 => 16 ✔
   ```

3. `110101 + 110011`

   `=> -21 + -19 = -40`

   ```
   110101
   110011
   ------
   101000 => 8 + 32 = 40 ✔
   ```

4.  `001111 + 111111`

   `=> 15 + -1 = 14`

   ```
   001111
   111111
   ------
   001110 => 14 ✔
   ```

When adding binary integers, the result might exceed the range can be represented

**EXAMPLE**

What is the result of adding these 4-bit binary integers? 

```
1111 + 0001 (UNSIGNED)
======================
 1111 => 15
 0001 => 1
 ----------
10000 => 16 ✔ BUT IT OVERFLOWS so it turns to 0 ✘
```

```
0111 + 0001 (SIGNED TWO'S COMPLEMENT)
=====================================
 0111 => 7
 0001 => 1
----------
01000 => -8 ✘
```

```
1000 + 1000 (SIGNED TWO'S COMPLEMENT)
=====================================
 1000 = -8
 1000 = -8
----------
 0000 => 0 ✘
```

---

**OVERFLOW**: When result is too large to be represented

Overflow occurs with unsigned integers when the MSD sum produces a carry-out, and occurs with two's complement signed integers when the signs of both operands are the same and the sign of sum is different

What if the two's complement integers are different sizes? 

**EXAMPLE** 

Add the two's complement integers

```
010011 => 19
   011 =>  3
------------
010110 => 22 ✔
```

```
001010 => 10
000110 => -2
------------
010000 => 16 ✘
```

Filling in with zero's does not work with negative numbers. 

```
  001010
  111110 (Fill it up with 1's instead of 0's)
  ------
1|001000 => 8 ✔
```

Computer logic applies rules to solve problems and to make decisions about data, as well as interprets the bits as truth values. 

* `A AND B`: Both are `true => true`
* `A OR B`: At least one is `true => true`
* `A XOR B`: Exclusively one is `true` (not both) `=> true`
* `NOT A`: A is not `true => true`

Truth tables specify all input permutations 

| `A B` | `A AND B` | `A OR B` | `A XOR B` | `NOT A` |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | --------- | ------- |
| `0 0` | `0`       | `0`      | `0`       | `1`     |
| `0 1` | `0`       | `1`      | `1`       | `1`     |
| `1 0` | `0`       | `1`      | `1`       | `0`     |
| `1 1` | `1`       | `1`      | `0`       | `0`     |

**BITWISE EXECUTION**: When one applies logic to a group of bits that logic is applied to each bit in sequence

**EXAMPLE**

What is the result of `NOT 101011`? `=> 010100` 

What is the result of  

```
    101011		   101011		101011
AND 011101		OR 011101 	XOR 011101
----------		   ------		------
    001001		   111111		110110
```

(simply conduct operations on each pair of numbers)

---

**MASK**: A pattern of bits used to clear/set all or some of the bits in an input group

To clear input to 0, use `AND` with 0's in mask

To set input to 1, use `OR` with 1's in mask

**EXAMPLE**

```
	101011		101010
AND 000000	 OR 111111
	------		------
	000000		111111 
```

|  0111  |  7   |    7    |  1111  |  F   |   15    |

Hex is a much more compact (and therefore less error-prone) notation than binary. It is also not a new data type; it just takes binary and writes it down in a much more compact way 

**BINARY => HEX** 

1. Start on right and separate bits into groups of 4
2. Replace each group

**EXAMPLE** 

What is the hex equivalent of 

```
1101011111001011000

110 1011 1110 0101 1000

0110 1011 1110 0101 1000
6    B    E    5    8

=> 6BE58
