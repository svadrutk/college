* Data represents information such as quantities/chars/other symbols
* Data is particular values that conform to specific types/structures
* **Example data types**: 
  * Integers
  * Natural Numbers
  * Whole Numbers
  * Real Numbers
* Can be simple (single values, usually called primitives/scalars)
  * Number of people in a room
  * First letter of your first name
* Simple data can be combined together to make complex composites
  * File formats like .jpg, .png, .pdf
  * Strings
* Computers (usually) transmit data using electric signals, measured by voltage
  * **VOLTAGE**: The amount of "pressure" on electrons pushing them through a certain conductor
  * **HIGH STATE**: The presence of voltage (usually at a range of V, from 2.5-3.5, etc.)
  * **LOW STATE**: Absence of voltage
* Computers can STORE data electrically, optically, or magnetically
* Computers are binary digital systems; they can have a finite set of states (2)
* However, there are also analog systems (e.g. battery connected to a circuit) where there are an infinite number of states
* **BIT**: The smallest form of data; stands for <u>bi</u>nary dig<u>it</u>
* **ENCODING**: The process for converting one representation of info to another
* Values with more than 2 states require more than 1 bit; A value with 2 bits could have 4 states
* Therefore, 

$$
n\text{ bits} = 2^n \ \text{different states}
$$

* A data type specifies a representation of data and the operations on said data

* **UNSIGNED INTEGER**: A data type that represents whole numbers; these are represented with â†“
* **WEIGHTED POSITIONAL NOTATION**: A sequence of digits weighted by their position in the sequence

**EXAMPLE PROBLEM** 

Show the values below in weighted positional notation
$$
703 \\
\fbox{$7 \cross 10^2 + 0 \cross 10 + 3$}
$$

$$
110 \ \text{(but this time in binary!)} \\ 
1 \cross 2^2 + 1 \cross 2 + 0 = \fbox{6}
$$

* **BASE**: The count of how many digit numbers are used in the number system 
  * **BASE 10**: Decimal 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  * **BASE 2**: Binary 0 1 
* **MOST SIGNIFICANT DIGIT**(MSD): Left side; the digit that contributes the most to the value
* **LEAST SIGNIFICANT DIGIT**(LSD): Right side; the digit that contributes the least to the value

**EXAMPLE PROBLEM**

What base 10 value is represented by the bits

* 1111? 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15
* 0101? 1 + 4 = 5
* 1001? 1 + 8 = 9 
* 0100? 4 

What is the range of unsigned integers that can be represented with 10 bits? 16 bits? 

10 bits: 0...1023 (**NOT 1024**)

16 bits: 65535 (**NOT 65536**)

---

* **SIGNED INTEGER**: A data type that allows us to represent all integers; remember that the left-most bit is the SIGN
  * 0 = positive, 1 = negative
* There are 3 common representations for signed integers: 
  * SIGN MAGNITUDE: $+5_{10} = 00101_2$ => Flip the sign => $-5_{10} = 10101_2$
  * 1'S COMPLEMENT: $+5_{10} = 00101_2$ => Flip everything => $-5_{10} = 11010_2$
  * 2'S COMPLEMENT: $+5_{10} = 00101_2$ => Flip everything => $11010_2$ => adding 1 => $11011_2$

**EXAMPLE PROBLEM**

Find the 2's complement of the following: 

```
1. 01000
01000 => 10111 => 11000
2. 10100 
10100 => 01011 => 01100
3. 00011
00011 => 11100 => 11101
4. 11111
11111 => 11111 => 100000
```

---

* 2's  Complement is preferred because the other representations have both +0 and -0 which can make it harder to do arithmetic in computer circuits

**EXAMPLE PROBLEM**

What is the range of 2's complement integers that can be represented with

```
5 bits? 2^5 = 32 => -16...15 
10 bits? 2^10 = 1024 => -512...511
15 bits? 2^15 = 32768 => -16389...16388

```

**BASE 2 TO BASE 10** 

1. If sign bit is 1, then negate to get positive
2. Determine magnitude of the positive value
3. If sign bit was 1, then add a minus sign

What is the base 10 value of 010110? 

16 + 4 + 2 = 22

What is the base 10 value of 110101? 

(negate to) 001011 => 8 + 2 + 1 = 11 => -11
