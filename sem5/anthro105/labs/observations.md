There is only one full skeleton in anatomical position. The rest only contain parts of the full skeleton, including a full lower body and one leg and what appears to be a skull at the top of the model. I am not quite sure what part of the body is at the top because it seems like it's on its side. Additionally, I am unsure whether the object in the bottom left is a leg or an arm.
