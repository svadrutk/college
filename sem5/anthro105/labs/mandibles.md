# Mandibles Observation
1. I am examining Case 2

2. 
Left/right third molar
Left second molar 
Left/right first molar
Left/right second premolar
Left/right first premolar
Left/right canine
Left/right lateral incisor
Left/right central incisor

3. The mandible is missing a right second molar as well as a piece of the body on the left side. The right side of the body also has a small hole in it. 

4. Since the mandible has all teeth other than one missing one, this indicates that the person has a full-grown set of teeth, therefore being an adult rather than a child. 

5. Males typically have a wider gonial angle than females. Additionally, females have a smoother and more rounded gonial region and is less robust and prominent compared to males. Males have a more square-shaped chin compared to females.


6. Judging from the sharp, large gonial angle and the square-shaped chin, I think the skeletal sex of this mandible is male.
