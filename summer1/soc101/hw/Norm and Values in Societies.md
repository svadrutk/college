# Norm and Values in Societies

## Japan

In Japan, one norm is treating higher-status people with extreme deference and respect. People in Japan do this because they value knowing how one stands in relation to others in a group. If higher-status people are treated with evident respect, it is clear to everyone what their standing is in the group, and makes for harmonious interactions. 

## Mexico

In Mexico, one norm is celebrating death with festivals like The Day of The Dead. People in Mexico do this because they believe in the importance of death, probably because Mexico's history has been so blood-soaked. Over the last few centuries, hundreds of thousands of people have died in Mexico's many wars, the latest being the drug wars. 

## San

Among the San people, one norm is distributing any food one gets among them. San people do this because they believe in the importance of sharing as a way of creating and maintaining friendships. Due to the extremely low amount of resources, sharing also helps the society survive, increasing the value's importance. 

## Egypt

Among Egyptian people, one norm is separating religion from secularism; Egyptians say such phrases such as *insha'Allah* (God willing) in everyday conversation, but rule of Egypt is strictly secular, with large portions of the population studying subjects like engineering, physics, and medicine. This can be attributed to the values that are shared between religion and Western civilization, such as justice and freedom. This helps explain why many religious figures protested in the Arab Spring against an extremist religious government. 

## Germany

A norm in Germany is them respecting environmentalism. The Green Party, an environment-focused party, has grown in popularity in Germany and has become part of the coalition governing Germany today. This can be attributed to the value of seriousness; Germans are very concerned with ideas and principles and work diligently to achieve their goals. 



# Mini-Analysis 2

The cultural norm I had the most trouble identifying the underlying value with was Germany. It took me a while to identify environmentalism with seriousness, since I didn't really know how to connect the two. However, now I realize that the concept of environmentalism appeals to Germans because their dedication to protecting the environment by sorting their trash into four separate piles or working hard enough to have the largest wind-power industry in Europe can be attributed to their dedication to their ideals.
