# Metacognition Activity -- Generating Good Study Habits

## First Study Habit
I will do readings before the lecture in order to understand the lecture better. In this way, I will have prior context to what the professor is lecturing about and can therefore analyze information faster and easier.
## Second Study Habit
I will form a study group for this class. This will help me keep on track with assignments and projects, and I can also use this as a resource whenever I'm stuck on certain parts of the course. 
## Third Study Habit
The third study habit I will have is study in a clean, distraction-free environment. This will help me completely my assignments and study more efficiently, as well as be a boost to my well-being.

The biggest obstacle that I am worried about is juggling this class along with two other classes I'm taking, along with my job and a few other programs I'm doing. I'm worried that I'll end up focusing on something else and neglect this course, resulting in a less learned material and a bad grade.
