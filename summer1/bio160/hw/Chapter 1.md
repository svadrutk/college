# Chapter 1

## 1.1

1. What are the five characteristics of life?

The five characteristics of life are 

* Organization (atoms => cells => molecules => etc.)
* Homeostasis (Maintaining internal constancy)
* Energy use (Uses energy)
* Reproduction (Produces offspring)
* Evolution (Follows evolution)

2. DNA is found at what level of life's hierarchy and how does DNA help promote life? 

DNA is a molecule. It helps promote life by storing genetic information that is used by cells to produce proteins which carry out most of cell function. 

3. What key ideas will help you distinguish an atom vs. a molecule vs. an organelle vs. a cell? 

An atom is the basic unit of matter. It is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. A molecule is a gathering of atoms. An organelle is a structure that is in a cell that has a specific function. A cell is the basic unit of life. 

4. Define emergent property and explain how it is incorporated into life's hierarchy. 

An emergent property is a function that arise from interaction between a system's components. 

5. Define homeostasis and why it is an important property to maintaining life. 

Homeostasis is the property of a system maintaining internal constancy. This is an important property to maintaining life because the conditions inside cells must stay within a certain range for the cell to remain alive. 

6. What is the importance of reproduction to maintaining life? How is asexual reproduction different from sexual reproduction? 

Reproduction is important to maintaining life because allows species to continue existing on Earth. Asexual reproduction differs from sexual reproduction in that asexual reproduction requires only one parent and all offspring are identical, whereas sexual reproduction requires two parents and offspring are extremely diverse. 

## 1.2

1. What are the three domains of life and how are they distinguished from each other? 

The three domains of life are Bacteria, Eukarya, and Archaea. 

Bacteria do not contain a nucleus, archaea have a different cell wall  (also live in extreme environments), eukarya contain a nucleus. 

## 1.3

1. *I found a flashlight and it will not turn on.* Identify each of the steps of the scientific method and apply statements that exemplify each step in order to get the flashlight to work again. 

* *Observation*: You have observed that the flashlight will not turn on, and note that it does not have batteries. You have also observed that another flashlight you have has batteries and works properly. 
* *Hypothesis*: You hypothesize that if you put batteries in the new flashlight you have found, it will turn on. 
* *Experimentation*: You first test that the flashlight works without the batteries. You then put the batteries in the flashlight and test again. 
* *Publication*: You publicize the results by telling your friends that flashlights work with batteries installed. 
* *Confirmation*: Your friend confirm this statement by testing if their broken flashlights work if they put batteries in. 

2. Define independent variable versus a dependent variable versus a standardized variable. 

An independent variable is the variable one manipulates in their experimentation. A dependent variable is the variable one is measuring in their experimentation.  A standardized variable is a variable that stays the same throughout the experimentation. 

3. What is the importance of statistics and what does it mean for something to be considered scientifically significant? 

Statistics are important because they ensure that the results of an experiment did not happen simply due to chance. Something if scientifically significant if the probability of that result occurring by chance is very low.

4. What is a placebo and what is its importance in an experiment? 

A placebo is an inert substance that is given to participants in a medical experiment that resembles the actual treatment the researchers are trying to test in order to ensure that the only thing affecting the experiment is the substance. 

5. ==Provide at least four things that limit scientific inquiry from saying something is proven, and provide one item that promotes the advancement of biology.== 

* Experimental evidence can lead to multiple interpretations
* Researchers may misinterpret experimental results
* The scientific community may not accept new evidence that suggests unexpected conclusions. 
* Science cannot answer many moral or subjective questions 

---

* Technology promotes the advancement of biology, since technology has provided evidence for new, modern scientific theories that upset previously thought conceptions. 

6. What is the difference between facts, scientific theory, hypotheses, and scientific laws? 

* FACTS: Repeatable observations that everybody can agree on 
* THEORY: Explains scientific observations 
* HYPOTHESIS: A falsifiable explanation for observations
* LAW: Describes scientific observations

Only protons and neutrons contribute to weight. 

3. Define radioactive. 

Radioactive isotopes are atoms with an extra amount of neutrons. When something is radioactive, it means that it emits ionizing radiation/particles as it breaks down into something more stable. 

4. What is the subatomic particle in an atom that promotes chemical bonding, and thus holds two atoms together in space? 

Electrons. 

5. What does it mean to say that a particular element is inert? 

A particular element is inert is if its valence shell (outermost shell of electrons) is completely full. As a result, the element will not bond with anything else. 

6. Define ion. 

The ion is an atom that has lost or gained electrons due to bonding with another atom. Ions can be positively or negative charged, based on if they have lost or gained electrons. Positive ions are cations and Negative ions are anions. 

7. What is the main difference between a polar covalent bond and a non-polar covalent bond? 

A polar covalent bond results if the electrons atoms are sharing are more attracted to one atom, due to its electronegativity relative to the other atoms. A non-polar covalent bond occurs if the electrons shared are attracted to neither of the atoms. 

8. What type of molecules form hydrogen bonds between each other -- polar molecules or non-polar molecules? 

Polar molecules form bonds between each other because the atom that has the lesser charge and has less electrons attracted to it are attracted to adjacent molecules, where one atom may have a high charge and will therefore be attracted to another atom with a lower charge. 

9. List the three different types of bonds in order of how strong the bond that is formed becomes. 

Hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, covalent bonds

10. What is the difference between cohesion and adhesion? 

Cohesion is the extent to which molecules stick to each other, whereas adhesion is the extent to which molecules stick to something else. Hydrogen bonds promote cohesion/adhesion.

The mitochondria consists of an outer membrane enclosing a mitochondrial matrix. The folds in that matrix are called cristae, adding a shit ton of surface area.

22. What is the function of chloroplasts? 

The chloroplast is the organelle that causes photosynthesis in eukaryotes. It consists of two membrane layers enclosing an enzyme-rich fluid called a stroma. Inside the stroma is a smaller membrane system that is flattened into thylakoids which are stacked into grana. 

23. What organelles were thought to be endosymbionts and what is the evidence that suggests these organelles may have been endosymbionts? 

Endosymbionts are organisms that were ingested by bacterial cells and made them part of their system. Both mitochondria and chloroplasts are thought to be endosymbionts.
