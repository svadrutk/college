1
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,417
Hello, ma'am. I study archaeology.

2
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:38,209
I'm looking for a book

3
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:40,834
by Alexander Cunningham.

4
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:42,709
Alright. Wait a moment.

5
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:43,584
Okay.

6
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:56,084
This is Cunningham's journal.

7
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,584
Have a look. Will this work for you?

8
00:02:58,751 --> 00:02:59,334
Let me see.

9
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:00,751
- Sure, ma'am.
- Thank you.

10
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:33,626
There was a period in my life when

11
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:35,917
every night before I slept.

12
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:39,584
I read a Very old Chinese book

13
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,376
from the Tang Dynasty.

14
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:47,376
The book was called A Journey To The West.

15
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,417
It was written by a monk named Xuanzang.

16
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:55,834
And in his book,
he described statues and temples all

17
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:59,584
surrounding a Very, Very important tree.

18
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:01,792
The tree, in fact, under which

19
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,667
enlightenment was granted
to Prince Siddhartha,the Buddha.

20
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,834
We found these ancient ruins.

21
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,709
The Mahabodhi Temple.

22
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:17,584
The Nalanda.

23
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:20,042
And in this digging,

24
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,126
we followed the path laid out by Xuanzang.

25
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,876
It was an exciting time.

26
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,042
And everywhere we went.

27
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:37,459
Xuanzang's descriptions and our discoveries

28
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:41,584
matched perfectly.

29
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:48,667
I've been in India five years already.

30
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:52,376
Mother said, in the year of the flood,

31
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,376
she put me in a wooden basket
that floated downstream.

32
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:58,417
She feared she'd never see me again.

33
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:02,334
Who'd have thought I floated into a temple

34
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:04,001
and an old monk saved me.

35
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:06,626
I've been a monk since childhood.

36
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,584
People say my brother took me there.

37
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:13,376
But I prefer to believe my mother.

38
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:15,751
I was fated to be a monk.

39
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,209
The night I left Chang'an

40
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,292
seems Very long ago.

41
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:06,917
By Imperial Decree,

42
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:13,501
We, in sympathy with the people and their plight,

43
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,584
issue a special order

44
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,876
that they may leave

45
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:24,417
and go to wherever, there is abundance

46
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,292
to survive the famine.

47
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,501
So be it.

48
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:25,584
The emperor

49
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:28,126
forbids travel to the West.

50
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,334
Therefore the other acolytes

51
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:33,417
won't travel with you to India.

52
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:38,001
Abbot. I've made up my mind.

53
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:42,292
You've mastered the Tripitaka.

54
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:45,584
I see no need for you to go ahead.

55
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,042
Although I am in Chang'an,

56
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,542
my heart is already on the road.

57
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,751
Natural disasters

58
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:57,334
left the land barren.

59
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:01,334
Years of drought led to mass famine.

60
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,709
Now, frost and locusts

61
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,084
forced people to flee their homes.

62
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:09,584
Buddhists could only pray.

63
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,209
But Buddhist texts came to China

64
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,709
in many different translations.

65
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,876
People argued points of faith.

66
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,042
Hearing the Sanskrit sutras,

67
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:22,542
I wanted to go to India

68
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,417
to find the true original texts.

69
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:39,334
Walking by day, resting by night,

70
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:40,876
I lived on dew and wind.

71
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:43,042
The further from Chang'an,

72
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,084
the more desolate the landscape.

73
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:48,376
This city is called Liangzhou.

74
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:51,167
It Wasn't just 'hang' - desolate,

75
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,417
but had an air of Violence,

76
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,334
abandonment and desperation.

77
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:13,917
Catch the spies!

78
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:53,417
Where did he come from?

79
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:54,792
Take him in for questioning.

80
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:13,751
Name.

81
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:16,834
The humble monk Xuanzang.

82
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,501
A monk poking his nose into trouble.

83
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:28,751
That's how you see it.

84
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,251
I see it as practicing my faith.

85
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:34,709
Why are you in Liangzhou?

86
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:38,001
I'm passing through on my way to Sidhu.

87
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:43,251
You want to practice your faith,
I won't stop you.

88
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:46,376
But pass through Liangzhou on your way to Sidhu?

89
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,251
I have to ask

90
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,001
do you have permission?

91
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:58,376
No.

92
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:00,751
No?

93
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:02,501
How'd you leave Chang'an?

94
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:04,542
With the refugees.

95
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,126
An illegal border crossing.

96
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,667
You put yourself at risk

97
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,334
and dragged me into it too.

98
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,501
Your trip ends in Liangzhou.

99
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,584
Forget going further west.

100
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:17,709
Ten years of study and not one true text.

101
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:21,042
I need to collect the scriptures
for the sake of the faith.

102
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:24,251
Don't you know the law?

103
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,626
His Majesty sent me, Li Daliang

104
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,459
to the western regions

105
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:29,834
to strengthen the borders.

106
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,292
Try to cross and it's a year in jail.

107
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,334
Succeed and you get worse.

108
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:40,001
I want Buddhism to endure, that's all.

109
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,292
Your devotion moves me. I won't punish you.

110
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,792
But today go back to Chang'an.

111
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:50,959
I'm ordering all officials

112
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:52,584
from here to the West

113
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,626
to arrest you on sight.

114
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,001
Your luck runs out here.

115
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:01,959
What's up?

116
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:14,667
Mahayana-samgraha-sastra

117
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:16,209
Volume One

118
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:21,084
Translation by Paramartha.

119
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:23,542
I've been thwarted, but I won't give up.

120
00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:26,667
I'll teach here in Liangzhou

121
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:30,042
until they've forgotten my quest.

122
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:34,126
Then the Venerable Hui Wei
will help me get away.

123
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:37,792
Master

124
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,001
Why do you wear a patchwork robe?

125
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:43,709
Buddha, meditating on the mountain,

126
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,126
saw the fields below

127
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:46,876
square, neat, clearly marked.

128
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:48,001
It gladdened his heart.

129
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,959
He had his disciples find scraps of cloth,

130
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,751
wash them clean

131
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,542
and sew them together

132
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,584
to resemble the fields.

133
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:57,251
It's Called a lucky-field robe.

134
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,626
A monk wears the robe

135
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:01,251
as the hill wears its fields,

136
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,459
sowing seeds of fortune with faith.

137
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:05,459
When a monk lectures

138
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:06,751
in a lucky-field robe

139
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,292
good fortune spreads outwards
and protects the living.

140
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:22,959
"Your blue robe, ever in my mind..."

141
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:26,334
Smells nice.

142
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:33,667
Venerable

143
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:35,626
my name is Li Chang.

144
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:41,126
Bless you.

145
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:45,626
M'1ord.

146
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,292
<i>Y mite not him, amenâ€œ: you'?</i>

147
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:12,959
Tell me the truth.

148
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:17,334
That way, I can help you out.

149
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,209
My name is Xuanzang and yes, I am that man.

150
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,792
Please help me out.

151
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:37,334
Since you admit it, I ought to arrest you

152
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:39,584
and return you to Liangzhou.

153
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:55,209
Yet seeing you

154
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,876
eating thin gruel out in the cold.

155
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:03,292
I saw how hard it is for a monk.

156
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:09,292
Hard, yes, but it's my destiny
and I am happy with it.

157
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:11,167
Why's that?

158
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:13,126
I think only of Buddha

159
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,626
and of the texts I'll find in Sidhu.

160
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,584
I fear you won't make it.

161
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:29,709
Say I let you pass by Guazhou.

162
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:32,084
You'll never get through Yumen Pass.

163
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:34,501
And the other road

164
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:36,459
winds around five Watchtowers

165
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,251
Three hundred miles apart, no water anywhere.

166
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:42,292
Generals guard all water sources.
It would defeat a god.

167
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:44,417
Say you make it past the five.

168
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,876
Behind lies the Vast Gobi Desert,

169
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,584
just hot Winds and desolation.

170
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:56,751
Most camel trains don't make it out alive.

171
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:03,917
On your own without even a horse

172
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,542
all the way to Sidhu - forget it.

173
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:13,126
My advice return east to Chang'an.

174
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:20,459
Sir,

175
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:25,667
I've come this far. I won't turn back.

176
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:30,084
Should I die on the way,
it will be Without regret.

177
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:22,584
I got past Guazhou,

178
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:26,667
grateful to Li Chang,
who took risks to help me.

179
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:29,084
Although he tore up the Warrant

180
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:33,167
Liangzhou had sent them
to every western guard post.

181
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:34,959
From now on

182
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:39,001
at no pass could I let down my guard.

183
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,667
Otherwise, I'd fail in my quest.

184
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:45,084
From ancient times,

185
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:47,167
monks have traveled with merchant caravans.

186
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,459
I was grateful to them

187
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:51,709
for taking me time and again.

188
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:15,334
How'd you get those out?

189
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,709
At the frontier

190
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,626
they were still just eggs.

191
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:23,626
They didn't find them.

192
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:28,334
The mulberry leaves should last to Cuiye.

193
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:32,751
By then, they'll be making cocoons.

194
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:39,417
Cocoons - that means silk.

195
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,959
Weaving is an important art.

196
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:44,584
I've thought it through.

197
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:48,834
Next time I'm in the south,
I'll marry a Weaving girl to take home.

198
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:50,376
I'll treat her really well.

199
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:54,167
And We'll make silk.

200
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:59,792
With silk, I don't have to work so hard

201
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,251
lugging stuff here and there.

202
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,584
May you be blessed.

203
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:06,376
You're a good man.

204
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:09,751
Venerable, I have a question.

205
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:12,501
What is the world, really?

206
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:15,376
My world

207
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:17,917
is taking things this place has

208
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:20,292
to a place without them.

209
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:24,542
Coming in, I bring what China lacks

210
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:26,459
what you call

211
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:30,751
"barbarian" pepper, flax and carrot seeds.

212
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,959
Going out, I want to take silkworms With me.

213
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:39,417
This is my world.

214
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:41,501
I am going to India for scriptures

215
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,667
to fill a lack as well.

216
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:47,417
Monk,

217
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:50,792
we're going to pick up the pace.

218
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:53,459
Why don't you ride on a camel?

219
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,959
No need. I'll try to keep up.

220
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:18,001
Random encounters and farewells

221
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:20,501
gave joy followed by loneliness.

222
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:22,959
When I said goodbye

223
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:25,334
I was filled with worry for them.

224
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:29,542
Bandits often ambushed caravans

225
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:33,334
who had no defense against their Violence.

226
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,042
Please, good sir,

227
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:55,292
are any caravans heading West?

228
00:23:58,709 --> 00:23:59,751
Please, good sir,

229
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:02,126
are any caravans heading West?

230
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:08,459
Monk,

231
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:11,042
there's fighting there, it's dangerous.

232
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:14,251
Forget it. No one's going.

233
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:18,876
Please, good sir,

234
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,792
are any caravans heading West?

235
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,459
Heading west?

236
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:23,667
Venerable

237
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:26,542
I'm heading West. I'll take you.

238
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:59,876
Is Sidhu far?

239
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,292
Very-

240
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:04,792
And you're going alone?

241
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:06,292
Yes.

242
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:08,667
Why?

243
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:10,584
Why?

244
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,459
It's my fate, I guess.

245
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:21,001
All right. Leave me here.

246
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:50,959
Liao Wu,

247
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:54,459
a monk may be coming to Visit.

248
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:55,667
Abbot,

249
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:58,084
No one has come for six months.

250
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:05,292
Last night I dreamed a monk
was sitting on a lotus

251
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:07,792
flying from east to west.

252
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:13,042
Don't disturb him.

253
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:19,667
Bodhisattva, help your disciple.

254
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:21,917
This journey from Chang'an

255
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:24,626
is harder than I ever imagined.

256
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,584
The road to India is long

257
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:30,709
and all I see is desolation.

258
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,792
It leaves me dazed and yet your disciple
doesn't waver from his goal.

259
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,501
Please, help me.

260
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,584
I need Buddha's support

261
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:42,876
to reach India and the scriptures.

262
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:06,209
Good sir,

263
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,792
You've followed me a while.
Why not Walk with me?

264
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:12,209
I'm not worthy.

265
00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:15,667
The abbot had a dream about you.

266
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,917
I'm Vandak. I've chased after you

267
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:19,167
to bring you food.

268
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,459
Please, instruct me.

269
00:27:36,376 --> 00:27:37,667
Buddha gives loving protection

270
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,209
to those of pure heart

271
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,376
and trust in the 'three treasures'.

272
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:47,251
These are Buddha, Dharma and monkhood.

273
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:48,542
Do you understand?

274
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,042
I do.

275
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:53,542
Five basic precepts govern the life of the monk.

276
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:56,209
Monks and other seekers

277
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:58,334
of inner peace follow them

278
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:02,126
no killing, no stealing, no lust,

279
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:04,292
no lying, no drinking.

280
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:08,917
I see.

281
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:12,626
It's not a big price for release.

282
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:14,834
One, no killing, two, no stealing,

283
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:17,042
three, no lust, four, no lying,

284
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:17,834
five...

285
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,001
no drinking.

286
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,001
It was hard going for a While.

287
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:36,001
Vandak showed me many shortcuts.

288
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:39,292
He'd been in a gang robbing caravans.

289
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:42,292
But they fought over the spoils.

290
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:45,584
He chose VOWS over impossible revenge.

291
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:47,834
This released him from Vexation.

292
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:51,084
When I told him I had no travel permit

293
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:54,667
Vandak was startled, it was a shock.

294
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:58,917
He knew illegal crossings could get you killed.

295
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:03,959
He was fearful and wavering.

296
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:11,626
Master, do you know where India is?

297
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:12,667
In my heart.

298
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:16,501
So you don't know.

299
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:19,251
Except for the road ahead

300
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,626
you know nothing and see nothing.

301
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:25,126
Can you really find Buddha?

302
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:27,792
You've put aside older cares

303
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:29,542
and taken on new ones

304
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:52,084
Vandak.

305
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:53,667
Yes, master?

306
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,042
Last night you wanted to kill me.

307
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,959
It's true, I had thoughts of murder.

308
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:03,501
Why didn't you do it?

309
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:05,209
I was torn, confused.

310
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:20,167
Master, I've been full of regret.

311
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:23,417
Please, return to Chang'an.

312
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:26,417
You can go home.

313
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:29,584
If you won't turn back,

314
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:31,001
it'll be the end of me.

315
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,542
Master, The Five Peaks lay ahead.

316
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:37,792
I can't get you past the guard post.

317
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,042
You'll be arrested.

318
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:40,251
That's not your problem.

319
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:42,251
But if they learn I helped you,

320
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:43,917
they won't just kill me

321
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:45,876
but my whole family will be in danger.

322
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:47,001
That's why, last night,

323
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,376
I thought to kill you.

324
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:55,751
Vandak.

325
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,292
Our connection is unbroken.

326
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,751
Go.

327
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,292
Even if I am arrested,

328
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:07,626
even if I am tortured,

329
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:09,959
I will never tell them about you.

330
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:11,917
Hurry, go.

331
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:13,709
- Master.
- Go.

332
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:33,209
Master. The road to Yiwu is long.

333
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:36,292
Find an old horse that knows the way.

334
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:07,126
Ahead lies the Vast desert.

335
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:09,334
If you insist on going,

336
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:12,042
then take my horse as an offering.

337
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:14,459
It's sturdy and knows the Way.

338
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,959
Still. The River of Flowing Sand,

339
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,626
takes nine lives out of ten.

340
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:21,251
Venerable, please reconsider.

341
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:31,751
The Tang monk

342
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:34,126
you only just got this far?

343
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:35,542
IVS you!

344
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:37,084
You're still by yourself'?

345
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:39,209
Yes.

346
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:42,917
Look after this horse

347
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,751
she's a pretty old horse.

348
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,334
I understand.

349
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:51,042
Will you return?

350
00:33:55,584 --> 00:33:56,417
Yes.

351
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:27,751
Who are you?

352
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:29,709
A monk

353
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:31,459
from the capital.

354
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:33,167
Please spare me.

355
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,667
You can't be Xuanzang.

356
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:05,876
News from the east says

357
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:09,917
Xuanzang is returning to Chang'an.

358
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:12,459
All of you, leave us.

359
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:22,209
I don't want to know your name.

360
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:25,917
So don't tell me.

361
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:32,376
It's the middle of the night.

362
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,417
If you were in a temple now

363
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:36,542
what would you be doing?

364
00:36:39,334 --> 00:36:40,459
Early prayers.

365
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:48,917
Is that Dharma, Buddhist law?

366
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,709
I know nothing about it.

367
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:57,959
Have a seat.

368
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,584
Taking monastic VOWS

369
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:37,376
seems to make a man happy -

370
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:40,042
but not at ease.

371
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:42,209
More at ease in fact.

372
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:46,209
Why?

373
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:49,792
We know what to do and what not to do.

374
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:50,667
It requires no thought.

375
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:53,501
In his enlightenment, Buddha realized

376
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:55,959
the 'four noble truths'.

377
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:57,126
What's that about?

378
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:00,001
Suffering. Release.

379
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:04,001
Suffering.

380
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:07,292
Release.

381
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,167
I've guarded this place for seven years

382
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:21,542
and all I know is suffering.
How can I find release?

383
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:24,042
Why do you suffer?

384
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:26,709
You have to ask?

385
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:32,292
The watchtower is my prison.

386
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:41,834
To you, the watchtower is like a prison.

387
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:44,459
To me, starved for 300 miles,

388
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:46,376
and finding here food and Water,

389
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,001
it is a place of deliverance.

390
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:51,292
Nothing in life is constant.

391
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:54,751
Venerable, I spend all day waiting for night

392
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,834
so I can sleep and dream.

393
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,042
Dream as in fantasies?

394
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,126
No.

395
00:39:02,751 --> 00:39:06,876
Just dream. Like everyone does

396
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:09,209
no matter how hard their day.

397
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:12,834
So long as I am dreaming

398
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:15,251
I am happy-

399
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:20,084
I often dream I'm wearing fancy Tang robes,

400
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:21,459
strolling through Chang'an.

401
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:24,792
Then I wake into a different world.

402
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:26,167
Dreams are wine.

403
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:30,209
Life is dregs.

404
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:35,251
Your insight moves me deeply.

405
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:39,417
The first Noble Truth - impermanence

406
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:40,876
There are three others.

407
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,001
Desire is suffering.

408
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:46,959
There is no self in Dharma. Nirvana is stillness.

409
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:50,084
These are the Four Noble Truths.

410
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:52,376
I give them to you.

411
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:02,876
Venerable. To avoid the Watchtowers

412
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:04,542
is impossible.

413
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:07,292
You must go southwest instead.

414
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:09,292
And cross the Taklamakan.

415
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:12,792
If you can find Wild Horse Spring

416
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,334
you'll make it.

417
00:40:15,334 --> 00:40:16,459
If you can't,

418
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,084
then you must turn back.

419
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,084
I'll wait here for you.

420
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:20,959
So I've heard

421
00:41:21,126 --> 00:41:21,959
Amitabha

422
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:22,834
Idealism

423
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:24,209
Nalanda

424
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,417
All is emptiness

425
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:31,251
Walking alone in the desert,

426
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:33,917
it seems like it will never end.

427
00:41:35,084 --> 00:41:36,501
No one speaks with you,

428
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:39,042
no bird or animal to make a sound,

429
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:44,626
and you have only the wind
and your own shadow to talk to.

430
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,626
C'mon.

431
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:01,667
C'mon.

432
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:05,667
What is it?

433
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:09,292
If we waver for a moment,

434
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:11,751
we'll be back on the road to Chang'an.

435
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,209
We'll get out of here.

436
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:15,209
C'mon.

437
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:18,042
Come.

438
00:44:22,334 --> 00:44:27,126
C'mon.

439
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,126
C'mon.

440
00:44:33,334 --> 00:44:34,001
All right.

441
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,459
Maybe you're right.

442
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:38,001
There's water back at the watchtower.

443
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:46,834
But no, we have to keep going.

444
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:47,626
You'll make it.

445
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:49,501
You will. Let's go.

446
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:22,459
Maybe it's like Wang Xiang said -

447
00:45:23,126 --> 00:45:25,459
this is a dream that feels real,

448
00:45:26,584 --> 00:45:28,667
but I am only traveling in my sleep.

449
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:30,834
Or perhaps I'm really on my way

450
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:33,167
but have entered a world of illusion.

451
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:41,501
Not only will you see rivers of sand

452
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:45,376
but there are invisible demons

453
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:50,334
that follow people there, shadowing them.

454
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:55,542
It's said, they can conjure up mirages

455
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:57,042
to confuse the traveller.

456
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:58,876
There's no way out.

457
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,584
I, the humble monk Xuanzang,

458
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:09,251
<i>in the 20th year of W en Di' s reign
was hem 'm Geu County , Luozhou.</i>

459
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:14,292
My surname is Chen.
My mother died when I was five.

460
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:19,126
When I was seven,
my father schooled me in the classics.

461
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:21,751
He died when I was ten. With my older brother

462
00:50:22,334 --> 00:50:25,084
I went to the Pure Land Temple to study Dharma,

463
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:27,251
and became a monk at thirteen.

464
00:50:27,959 --> 00:50:31,251
I read the Nirvana Sutra
and the Mahayana Compendium.

465
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:34,209
Later, in the southwest

466
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:37,126
I both studied and taught.

467
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:47,834
And now I will die here in the Gashun Gobi.

468
00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:49,667
There is no way out.

469
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:54,292
There is no way out.

470
00:51:21,709 --> 00:51:22,376
Son -

471
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:25,667
Yesterday I dreamed you'd grown up

472
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:30,709
and rode a white horse to a Very faraway place.

473
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:39,542
Mother. What are you saying?

474
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:43,126
What are you saying?

475
00:56:09,876 --> 00:56:11,584
When I stopped at Yiwu

476
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:14,126
I heard the sound of hooves.

477
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:16,751
Ga0chang's king wanted to see me.

478
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:19,209
But I wasn't headed to Gaochang.

479
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:21,959
It was hard for the King of Yiwu.

480
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:27,667
Gaochang, it's a big country.

481
00:56:27,959 --> 00:56:29,584
We are all afraid of it.

482
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:32,667
Venerable, if you don't go,

483
00:56:32,834 --> 00:56:34,626
I fear he'll invade Yiwu.

484
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:37,792
So, please, go to Gaochang.

485
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:39,876
You must go.

486
00:58:34,251 --> 00:58:37,542
Venerable,
As a boy, with my father the king,

487
00:58:37,709 --> 00:58:39,584
I traveled to your great cities

488
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:44,667
wealthy places like Yan, Dai, Fen, J in.

489
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:47,251
They deeply impressed on me

490
00:58:47,584 --> 00:58:51,126
I saw there was an art to ruling.

491
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:57,959
Please, Venerable,
what can Buddhism teach a king?

492
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:00,792
What I know is this:

493
00:59:01,084 --> 00:59:03,334
to safeguard the country,
be charitable and upright,

494
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:05,959
and you protect all living things.

495
00:59:07,084 --> 00:59:09,001
If you help spread the faith

496
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:11,501
you don't only enrich one kingdom

497
00:59:11,834 --> 00:59:13,501
but bring peace to all.

498
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:18,376
May I ask, Venerable, what scripture says this?

499
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:21,584
The Prajnaparamita Sutras.

500
00:59:23,876 --> 00:59:26,751
Please, Venerable
Take me as your student.

501
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:33,917
I was moved by the king's sincerity

502
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:36,417
and rested here for a while.

503
00:59:36,584 --> 00:59:39,417
I taught scripture, months passed.

504
00:59:58,501 --> 01:00:01,584
Gaochang is prosperous and has many faithful.

505
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:05,334
They'll look after you. You stay here,

506
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:09,959
and have a good life. I've kept my word.

507
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:14,084
Now I must be on my way.

508
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:31,834
Venerable, I've pledged
to support you your whole life.

509
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:35,542
And commanded my people to become your disciples.

510
01:00:35,709 --> 01:00:38,751
All these offerings express my sincere desire

511
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:42,834
that you, Venerable can help your disciple

512
01:00:43,459 --> 01:00:47,459
by staying in Gaochang.
Forget the journey to the west.

513
01:00:57,626 --> 01:01:00,959
Your offer is generous, but I can't accept.

514
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:02,834
My sense of purpose

515
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:07,167
grows stronger every day.
I cannot give up my quest.

516
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:09,834
Please, let me go.

517
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:24,459
I'll put it bluntly

518
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:28,292
because Gaochang has no other Buddhist teacher,

519
01:01:28,459 --> 01:01:30,917
we have to impose on you. Guide us

520
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:32,584
out of darkness.

521
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,251
If you still Won't agree,
I'll be Very clear with you.

522
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:57,376
You have two choices.

523
01:01:57,959 --> 01:01:59,876
One, stay in Gaochang

524
01:02:00,376 --> 01:02:01,751
and accept our support.

525
01:02:02,042 --> 01:02:05,459
Two, be forcibly returned to the Tang.

526
01:02:10,584 --> 01:02:13,417
Sir, you can imprison my body

527
01:02:13,709 --> 01:02:17,501
but not my spirit.

528
01:03:01,542 --> 01:03:05,292
Venerable, our king invites you to eat.

529
01:04:22,584 --> 01:04:26,167
I've done a terrible thing,
causing you such grief.

530
01:04:29,501 --> 01:04:34,292
I won't detain you any longer.
Please take some food,

531
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:36,792
Venerable.

532
01:05:34,459 --> 01:05:36,626
I reconciled with the king.

533
01:05:36,959 --> 01:05:38,376
People accompanied me on my way.

534
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,167
Buddhism was growing in influence.

535
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:44,292
People treated us as guests of honour.

536
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:46,751
After the beautiful music of Kucina

537
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:48,417
what awaited us

538
01:05:48,584 --> 01:05:51,209
were the dangerous peaks of Lingshan

539
01:08:35,126 --> 01:08:37,209
After a few dangerous, hard years,

540
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:39,001
we reached Suyab

541
01:08:39,334 --> 01:08:40,501
in Turkestan,

542
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:42,834
crossed the central Asian steppes,

543
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:45,376
and finally reached Sidhu.

544
01:10:02,417 --> 01:10:04,626
Finally, I was in NÃ©landfi.

545
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:08,292
Finally, I was in the temple of my dreams.

546
01:10:10,126 --> 01:10:10,917
I'm here.

547
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:13,334
I'm here.

548
01:12:07,459 --> 01:12:08,459
Young man,

549
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:12,917
where have you come from?

550
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:14,917
Master,

551
01:12:15,084 --> 01:12:16,626
My name is Xuanzang.

552
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:20,709
I've come from the Tang.

553
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:29,084
How long did it take you?

554
01:12:29,376 --> 01:12:31,501
Four years.

555
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:42,834
Why have you come to Nfilandfi?

556
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:44,584
Master,

557
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:55,001
I came to study YogficÃ©ra with you.

558
01:12:55,459 --> 01:13:00,542
Wonderful. Good.

559
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:05,001
Three years ago,

560
01:13:06,209 --> 01:13:12,376
the Bodhisattvas

561
01:13:14,042 --> 01:13:16,709
Maitreya

562
01:13:17,584 --> 01:13:21,876
and Manjusri

563
01:13:22,209 --> 01:13:28,417
came to me in a dream

564
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:31,084
and said:

565
01:13:31,417 --> 01:13:41,709
"a monk from the Tang

566
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:48,542
will study Dharma with you."

567
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:55,459
Amitabha, Amitabha, Amitabha

568
01:14:17,751 --> 01:14:19,917
Rise, young man.

569
01:14:30,126 --> 01:14:37,876
I have lived this long awaiting your arrival.

570
01:15:09,751 --> 01:15:18,042
When the good person faces death

571
01:15:18,792 --> 01:15:27,251
They are freed from torment and desire.

572
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:33,001
When the bad face death

573
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:41,584
they are haunted by What awaits them.

574
01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:06,417
Five years passed.

575
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:09,584
I'd return to Chang'an soon.

576
01:16:10,126 --> 01:16:13,292
I wanted to see Sidhu first.

577
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:17,417
Without thinking, another five years.
passed like that.

578
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:23,251
Finally, I came to Mahabodhi,

579
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:25,959
where Buddha achieved enlightenment.

580
01:16:26,251 --> 01:16:28,334
It is a sacred place of pilgrimage.

581
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:32,126
Approaching, I felt I saw the Buddha,

582
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:34,834
like I was speaking with him.

583
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:38,709
That moment thrilled me to the core.

584
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:08,501
I've heard that in the Tang,

585
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:12,084
people eat leeks and garlic.

586
01:17:12,251 --> 01:17:16,459
They're not banned for lay people.

587
01:17:16,751 --> 01:17:22,167
Here, if you eat such things
you're chased out of town.

588
01:17:22,334 --> 01:17:25,084
But ginger and mustard are fine.

589
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:29,459
Different places, different customs.

590
01:17:29,626 --> 01:17:32,167
At home, we use chopsticks

591
01:17:32,334 --> 01:17:38,876
but here, hands,
so we must Wash them before meals.

592
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:03,042
Swami, I have a question.
I blink and that star disappears.

593
01:18:03,209 --> 01:18:06,084
Is this what is called a "ksana"?

594
01:18:06,959 --> 01:18:11,042
The eye is not quick enough to perceive a ksana.

595
01:18:12,584 --> 01:18:15,126
How long is a ksana?

596
01:18:18,001 --> 01:18:20,792
Take this movement.

597
01:18:21,834 --> 01:18:25,917
Divide it into 75 parts

598
01:18:26,251 --> 01:18:27,917
each of these is a ksana.

599
01:18:28,084 --> 01:18:32,792
So that's how you measure it.

600
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:37,751
Impossible to grasp.

601
01:18:41,292 --> 01:18:45,792
"Ksana" - a Sanskrit word.
In Chinese, "nianqin"

602
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:48,792
the time it takes for a thought to form.

603
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:52,209
People often say: "hold in one's heart"

604
01:18:52,501 --> 01:18:55,626
This "hold" - niannian also comes from Buddhism.

605
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:58,709
It's meaning is beyond words.

606
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:15,626
I followed the footsteps of Buddha,

607
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,126
seeking his path to enlightenment.

608
01:19:19,501 --> 01:19:22,667
Buddha was the rich and spoiled prince

609
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:24,251
Siddhartha Gautama.

610
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:26,667
In his youth,

611
01:19:27,584 --> 01:19:29,751
he knew nothing of the world's suffering.

612
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:31,751
Then, one day,

613
01:19:32,542 --> 01:19:36,209
he saw an old man, a sick man and a poor man.

614
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:39,459
To release the world from suffering,

615
01:19:40,001 --> 01:19:41,834
He left town in the dark of night.

616
01:19:42,459 --> 01:19:45,417
He thought deeply on the path that led to Nirvana.

617
01:19:46,834 --> 01:19:49,167
The world today is full of war,

618
01:19:49,626 --> 01:19:51,626
inequality and Violence.

619
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:55,834
Yet, though I am of this troubled earth,

620
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:01,459
my heart is planted in Sukhfwati, Land of Bliss.

621
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:23,667
Hello, sir.

622
01:20:23,834 --> 01:20:27,001
Why not Walk in the middle?

623
01:20:32,542 --> 01:20:35,084
I'll tell you the answer.

624
01:20:37,084 --> 01:20:44,667
Butchers, prostitutes, beggars and <i>so</i> on

625
01:20:44,834 --> 01:20:47,126
are not allowed in town.

626
01:20:47,751 --> 01:20:50,917
If they have business here,

627
01:20:51,084 --> 01:20:55,084
they must avoid the main roads
and walk on the sides.

628
01:20:55,542 --> 01:20:57,792
But this is the land of the Buddha.

629
01:20:58,209 --> 01:21:03,667
Who said all are equal.
It shouldn't be like this.

630
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:05,167
Venerable, it's not so strange.

631
01:21:05,709 --> 01:21:07,459
Although it is the Buddha's country,

632
01:21:08,626 --> 01:21:14,584
but his people are not all Buddhas.

633
01:21:46,376 --> 01:21:47,417
Hello

634
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:58,501
Amitabha.

635
01:22:07,292 --> 01:22:09,626
This fruit is sweeter.

636
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:14,917
The other ones will get a good price at market.

637
01:22:15,084 --> 01:22:18,792
Don't give them to me, sell them.

638
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:23,001
I'm meeting a man in the next Village.

639
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:26,376
Can you please take me there?

640
01:22:37,001 --> 01:22:37,876
Careful.

641
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:43,626
Why wear a mask on such a hot day?

642
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:49,417
Me... I'm a Slave. 1 was cursed by my master.

643
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:52,251
It's a symbol of my wrongdoing.

644
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:55,334
HOW did this come about?

645
01:22:55,501 --> 01:22:59,376
When I was Very little, I was orphaned

646
01:23:00,876 --> 01:23:03,334
and sold to a faraway Village

647
01:23:04,376 --> 01:23:06,792
as a slave to the Village chief's family.

648
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:12,626
Six months ago,
their house caught fire in the night.

649
01:23:15,126 --> 01:23:18,042
How dare you touch my daughter?

650
01:23:18,209 --> 01:23:22,042
You have brought us this bad luck.

651
01:23:22,209 --> 01:23:25,334
Get out, you Worthless slave!

652
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:29,334
No one must see your filthy face again.

653
01:23:30,792 --> 01:23:34,376
I've had to wear this ever since

654
01:23:35,251 --> 01:23:37,042
so no one sees my face.

655
01:23:37,459 --> 01:23:41,251
We live in a hut by the river.

656
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:47,209
And the curse cannot be lifted?

657
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:52,417
Only a Brahmin

658
01:23:53,042 --> 01:23:55,751
can release me from the mask.

659
01:23:58,001 --> 01:24:02,376
But who'd take pity on a poor slave?

660
01:24:05,459 --> 01:24:09,292
Kumari is the girl I saved.

661
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:22,542
J ayaram saved my life

662
01:24:23,167 --> 01:24:28,376
but my father said
the s1aVe's touch had dirtied me.

663
01:24:28,876 --> 01:24:34,459
Only by dying a Brahmin's funeral pyre

664
01:24:34,626 --> 01:24:37,084
could I be purified.

665
01:24:38,001 --> 01:24:40,834
So I ran away with J ayaram,

666
01:24:41,084 --> 01:24:47,209
far from my family, to live an itinerant life.

667
01:24:51,126 --> 01:24:52,667
Although I'm alive,

668
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:56,876
it's as though I'm dead.

669
01:25:46,251 --> 01:25:49,459
Good sir, Please have pity on J ayaram,

670
01:25:49,626 --> 01:25:55,459
who risked his life to save another.

671
01:25:55,626 --> 01:25:59,334
Please, have compassion
and release him from his curse.

672
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:08,167
As you've come all the way from China

673
01:26:08,334 --> 01:26:12,626
I will do this and release him.

674
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:17,792
And so the old Brahmin undid the curse,

675
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:19,626
giving J ayaram back his face.

676
01:26:20,126 --> 01:26:23,876
He said: "Bathe in the Ganges. After 10 days,

677
01:26:24,167 --> 01:26:25,334
take off the mask."

678
01:27:41,376 --> 01:27:43,084
A storm.

679
01:27:44,042 --> 01:27:46,626
The Wind's up.

680
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:51,834
The scriptures! My scriptures!

681
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:54,459
J ayaram !

682
01:28:56,209 --> 01:28:59,042
- Careful, J ayaram! Careful, J ayaram!
- J ayaram!

683
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:43,251
J ayaram !

684
01:29:44,792 --> 01:29:45,876
J ayaram !

685
01:30:47,751 --> 01:30:50,459
The gods removed J ayaram's mask

686
01:30:50,834 --> 01:30:54,542
And let his beautiful,
kind face be seen once more.

687
01:30:55,084 --> 01:30:56,751
This made me happy.

688
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,876
Master. Ten years studying, traveling,

689
01:31:08,042 --> 01:31:11,001
collecting scriptures and relics.
what's it all for?

690
01:31:12,209 --> 01:31:13,667
To take back to the Tang.

691
01:31:14,459 --> 01:31:17,459
Master, you are so popular here.

692
01:31:17,626 --> 01:31:18,792
Why go back to the Tang?

693
01:31:19,501 --> 01:31:20,501
What's popularity?

694
01:31:21,126 --> 01:31:22,292
To be loved.

695
01:31:23,251 --> 01:31:26,667
I left in order to return, not to be loved.

696
01:31:27,334 --> 01:31:30,084
The trip might take another four years.

697
01:31:30,917 --> 01:31:33,792
So long as I get there, four years is nothing.

698
01:31:38,751 --> 01:31:42,001
I will read Emperor Harsha's letter.

699
01:31:42,209 --> 01:31:45,042
I, Harsha, have travelled to Udra,

700
01:31:45,584 --> 01:31:47,209
Where they slander Mahayana.

701
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:52,376
I have heard that Nfilandfi is full of

702
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:55,126
wise and Virtuous monks.

703
01:31:55,292 --> 01:31:59,501
I respectfully ask for four learned monks

704
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:03,792
to take part in a theological debate.

705
01:32:04,084 --> 01:32:11,917
The Buddha says: "a monk should not argue."

706
01:32:12,751 --> 01:32:19,751
Yet if Dharma is at stake, we have no choice.

707
01:32:19,917 --> 01:32:22,709
And so. I will choose four monks

708
01:32:23,626 --> 01:32:27,126
to participate in the great debate.

709
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:29,084
Haihui.

710
01:32:29,251 --> 01:32:30,584
Zhiguaf1g-

711
01:32:32,417 --> 01:32:34,042
Simharsami.

712
01:32:38,876 --> 01:32:40,292
Xuanzang.

713
01:32:41,334 --> 01:32:44,792
You will take part.

714
01:32:48,959 --> 01:32:51,959
You will debate scripture,

715
01:32:52,917 --> 01:32:57,959
not just for the glory of Nalanda,

716
01:32:58,126 --> 01:33:03,542
but the truth of Dharma.

717
01:33:03,709 --> 01:33:07,917
Now, put my mind at ease.

718
01:33:08,542 --> 01:33:12,667
Each of you, say a few words.

719
01:33:12,834 --> 01:33:13,834
Abbot,

720
01:33:14,001 --> 01:33:16,834
I know Buddhist logic and language

721
01:33:17,084 --> 01:33:24,334
but in other areas of study, I'm not so confident.

722
01:33:24,501 --> 01:33:25,376
Abbot,

723
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:30,542
I fear that a great debate of 18 days

724
01:33:31,417 --> 01:33:33,126
is not for an old man like me.

725
01:33:37,376 --> 01:33:43,376
So modest! And if you're old, what am I?

726
01:33:44,876 --> 01:33:45,959
Abbot,

727
01:33:46,876 --> 01:33:50,501
I'm happy to represent Nalanda.

728
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:52,417
It's an honour.

729
01:33:53,251 --> 01:33:58,876
I came to Nalanda as a non-believer.
You converted me.

730
01:33:59,626 --> 01:34:02,376
I know Mahayana-samgraha

731
01:34:02,834 --> 01:34:05,126
and will triumph with it.

732
01:34:05,334 --> 01:34:11,042
Tell me about Hinayana and Mahayana.

733
01:34:11,709 --> 01:34:17,667
Hinayana aims at worthiness.
Mahayana aims at Buddhahood.

734
01:34:18,376 --> 01:34:23,292
And Prajnagupta's critiques of Mahayana?

735
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:24,917
I don't know them.

736
01:34:25,084 --> 01:34:29,709
But anyway, my arguments are better.

737
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:40,001
You underestimate Prajnagupta.

738
01:34:45,917 --> 01:34:47,084
Xuanzang,

739
01:34:48,001 --> 01:34:52,334
Can you tell me the difference

740
01:34:53,126 --> 01:34:54,584
between Mahayana and Hinayana?

741
01:34:57,917 --> 01:34:59,501
Yes, Abbot.

742
01:34:59,667 --> 01:35:01,834
Hinayana believes

743
01:35:02,001 --> 01:35:04,251
that the universe is material

744
01:35:04,417 --> 01:35:08,001
but perception illusory.

745
01:35:08,167 --> 01:35:10,959
But Mahayana believes

746
01:35:11,126 --> 01:35:15,376
that both perception and the universe
are mutable and illusory.

747
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:17,126
Mahayana sees the universe's true face.

748
01:35:17,292 --> 01:35:19,667
All is mutable, all is illusion.

749
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:21,251
Very good.

750
01:35:22,334 --> 01:35:25,209
You speak to the essence of it.

751
01:35:26,792 --> 01:35:29,251
My worries have dissolved.

752
01:35:29,501 --> 01:35:32,542
Today is a happy day.

753
01:35:33,251 --> 01:35:38,876
I praise and thank Lord Buddha.

754
01:36:05,084 --> 01:36:08,751
The Harsha Empire
was the greatest empire in Sidhu.

755
01:36:09,459 --> 01:36:13,001
Harsha brought together 18 kings
for a theological debate

756
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:15,792
that would affect all Sidhu.

757
01:36:33,042 --> 01:36:35,459
Welcome, learned and Virtuous monks.

758
01:36:35,792 --> 01:36:40,334
I convene this debate on Dharma

759
01:36:40,501 --> 01:36:43,542
in honour of the Buddha.

760
01:36:44,459 --> 01:36:46,167
We are here to discuss

761
01:36:46,709 --> 01:36:50,167
Hinayana and Mahayana.

762
01:36:51,084 --> 01:36:54,167
We have the Venerable Prajnagupta,

763
01:36:54,334 --> 01:36:58,167
author of 700 Verses against Mahayana

764
01:36:59,001 --> 01:37:03,917
and the Venerable Xuanzang of Nalanda,

765
01:37:04,209 --> 01:37:08,792
the author of 1600 Verses for it.

766
01:37:10,042 --> 01:37:12,584
The texts are on display.

767
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:19,001
Over the next 18 days, anyone with different ideas

768
01:37:19,626 --> 01:37:24,459
who wishes to present them, please speak up.

769
01:37:25,209 --> 01:37:28,001
At the end, we will celebrate the Victor

770
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:31,209
and pay homage to him

771
01:37:31,542 --> 01:37:36,084
as he parades on an elephant.

772
01:38:20,042 --> 01:38:22,292
All my arguments were written down.

773
01:38:23,292 --> 01:38:25,292
I wasn't nervous or worried.

774
01:38:25,959 --> 01:38:27,584
I loved the atmosphere,

775
01:38:28,084 --> 01:38:29,917
and the diversity there,

776
01:38:30,501 --> 01:38:34,459
like a lake fed by many streams,
brimming and full.

777
01:38:55,292 --> 01:38:58,001
Swami, you come from China.

778
01:38:58,667 --> 01:39:03,584
The drums recall the triumphal music

779
01:39:04,001 --> 01:39:07,834
of your emperor.

780
01:39:08,584 --> 01:39:13,209
Yes, tell us, what he has done

781
01:39:13,376 --> 01:39:17,126
to be so revered by his people?

782
01:39:18,251 --> 01:39:21,792
He is the Son of Heaven of the Tang,

783
01:39:21,959 --> 01:39:25,959
who was previously called "Qin".

784
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:29,542
The people love and support him.

785
01:39:30,667 --> 01:39:31,417
Of course,

786
01:39:32,626 --> 01:39:36,959
it is heaven's will that he rules.

787
01:39:53,751 --> 01:39:56,001
Hinayana' and 'Mahayana' are metaphors.

788
01:39:56,709 --> 01:39:59,334
To put it simply, they are like ferries.

789
01:40:00,042 --> 01:40:02,876
Hinayana - 'sma11Vehic1e'
transports an individual.

790
01:40:03,417 --> 01:40:06,334
Mahayana - 'greater Vehicle'
transports others as well.

791
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:07,792
Compassion.

792
01:40:08,542 --> 01:40:11,042
It is how Buddhism changes the world.

793
01:40:11,501 --> 01:40:14,417
Buddha forbid the taking of life,

794
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:16,959
including of those with other beliefs.

795
01:40:17,626 --> 01:40:19,459
Mahayana's love and tolerance

796
01:40:20,001 --> 01:40:21,501
can cleanse the world of Violence,

797
01:40:22,042 --> 01:40:23,709
and make it a more beautiful place.

798
01:40:24,292 --> 01:40:26,292
This is the greatness of Buddha.

799
01:40:34,959 --> 01:40:36,542
The great scriptural debate

800
01:40:36,959 --> 01:40:39,042
spread the Dharma far and wide.

801
01:40:39,917 --> 01:40:42,292
Winning didn't matter so much to me.

802
01:40:43,042 --> 01:40:44,126
It was the process,

803
01:40:44,584 --> 01:40:47,376
how the truth of Mahayana was spread,

804
01:40:48,001 --> 01:40:49,792
that gave it meaning.

805
01:40:57,751 --> 01:40:59,001
Eighteen days have passed.

806
01:41:00,542 --> 01:41:02,667
There was no need for debate.

807
01:41:03,917 --> 01:41:06,001
It was like when the sun rises,

808
01:41:06,917 --> 01:41:08,917
the fireflies stop glowing.

809
01:41:09,876 --> 01:41:14,209
Or when it's thundering, hammers are silenced.

810
01:41:14,751 --> 01:41:18,251
It was thus, that all other arguments

811
01:41:18,792 --> 01:41:22,792
faded away before Xuanzang's.

812
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:28,501
I congratulate him and Nalanda Temple

813
01:41:29,084 --> 01:41:30,542
for their Victory

814
01:42:14,376 --> 01:42:16,917
Venerable, please.

815
01:42:41,376 --> 01:42:43,959
At this moment, in my mind,

816
01:42:44,126 --> 01:42:46,167
I saw a monk called Xuanzang

817
01:42:46,334 --> 01:42:48,751
surrounded by admirers riding an elephant,

818
01:42:49,917 --> 01:42:52,584
applauded by all, praised by all,

819
01:42:52,959 --> 01:42:54,667
paraded in their midst.

820
01:42:56,334 --> 01:42:57,959
I can go home now,

821
01:42:59,334 --> 01:43:00,626
I want to go home.

822
01:43:16,542 --> 01:43:22,292
Buddhism is in decline in Sidhu.

823
01:43:22,459 --> 01:43:26,167
Only Nalanda keeps it alive.

824
01:43:26,751 --> 01:43:33,376
But it is advancing in the Tang.

825
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:41,834
You will help it to flourish there.

826
01:43:43,751 --> 01:43:46,376
The true Value of your journey to Sidhu

827
01:43:47,959 --> 01:43:52,626
lies there.

828
01:44:43,501 --> 01:44:46,334
When I think of home, I dream of my mother.

829
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:50,959
Although I was Very small when I lost her,

830
01:44:51,876 --> 01:44:54,667
her image often appears to me.

831
01:44:55,501 --> 01:44:58,542
It makes me feel homesick.

832
01:45:16,584 --> 01:45:18,709
The kings Harsha and J anaka Kumara

833
01:45:19,084 --> 01:45:21,042
want you to stay in Sidhu

834
01:45:23,126 --> 01:45:26,209
What do you think?

835
01:45:28,542 --> 01:45:31,834
This is the homeland of the Buddha.

836
01:45:32,001 --> 01:45:35,709
It's not that I don't love it,

837
01:45:35,876 --> 01:45:42,209
but I came for the scriptures,

838
01:45:42,417 --> 01:45:46,209
and I need to take them back.

839
01:45:48,417 --> 01:45:49,667
On the return journey,

840
01:45:50,417 --> 01:45:53,792
The emperor sent a party to meet me.

841
01:45:54,459 --> 01:45:56,209
They had an edict that said,

842
01:45:57,126 --> 01:45:59,292
Having gone west for the Dharma,

843
01:45:59,751 --> 01:46:03,459
the monk was returning,
and this truly delights us.

844
01:46:04,334 --> 01:46:08,376
All officials are to help him on his way.'

845
01:49:16,209 --> 01:49:18,584
I finally brought the scriptures home.

846
01:49:19,834 --> 01:49:21,834
Translating them into Chinese

847
01:49:22,251 --> 01:49:24,501
gave my life meaning.

848
01:49:25,126 --> 01:49:28,542
Nothing was more important.
