The aim of meditation practice is to become more mindful of oneself. As said in the Satipatthana Suttha, "He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation'; he trains thus: 'I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation'.". Thus, meditation helps the practitioner become aware that the body is simply that -- a body. Therefore, the practitioner can "[abide] independent, not clinging to anything in the world.". 

Sati, or mindfulness, can be achieved by consciously thinking of the body as a body, in whatever actions one does. Therefore, when one is eating or sleeping they must think of the body doing these things, and not them. They can then think of themselves as a separate entity and become more mindful. 

Meditation is important as an ethical practice because it cultivates mindfullness. By being mindful, one can more easily recognize harmful tendencies like greed, hatred, and ignorance, and avoid them. Meditation can also help to develop insight into the nature of reality, impermanence, and the non-self, which are the core concepts of Dharma.
