# Week 6 Primary Source Analysis 
> â€œNow this, monks, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.

These are the four noble truths, in my own words: 
1. Life has Suffering: Life involves pain, dissatisfaction, and things not always being as we want them to be.

2. The Cause of Suffering is Craving: Wanting things to be different or clinging to things causes suffering.

3. Suffering Can End: There is a way to stop suffering and find peace.

4. The Path to End Suffering: By following a certain way of living and thinking (the Eightfold Path), we can overcome suffering and find true happiness.

I find it interesting how the Buddha defines suffering as something akin to "clinging" -- the connotation is that one consciously *chooses* to suffer, rather than it simply happening to them.
