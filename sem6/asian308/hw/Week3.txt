Both the Nidana-katha and Jataka stories are forms of Buddha biographies. However, they present different sides of the Buddha and have different purposes in their messages. 

A quote from the Nidana-Katha: 

"When the fires of attachment, hatred and delusion are extinguished, and the cares of all the defilements such as those arising from arrogance and dogmatic beliefs are allayed, then only is one tranquilled"

The Nidana-katha are stories about the life of the Buddha. The main concern of the Nidana-katha is to highlight the virtues and qualities the Buddha learned and practiced in his life to become the Buddha. Some of these qualities include compassion, detachment from worldly desires, and patience. As the quote shows, the Buddha realized that one could only be truly tranquil if they detached themselves from human emotions. 

A quote from the Jataka: 

"If you desire lasting happiness, then avoid the zone of the
snakelike senses like poison."

The Jataka Tales are stories about previous lives of the Buddha. Similar to Aesop's Fables, they teach moral and ethical lessons through various short stories. They are similar to the Nidana-Katha in that they extol the same virtues that the Nidana-Katha does, but they are more easily applicable to everyday lives due to their more accessible and relatable stories. The qualities that the Jataka tales most talk about are having incorruptible moral integrity and ethical conduct.
