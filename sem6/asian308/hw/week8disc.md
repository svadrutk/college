# Week 8 Discussion

Interconnectedness is a fundamental concept in Buddhism, and it is quite applicable to modern life -- it can offer insights into issues like racial justice, climate change, and immigration. 

An example is climate change. Every action that humans take, such as driving a car or consuming meat, has repercussions that extend far beyond themselves. Humanity's carbon emissions contribute to global warming, which in turn affec ts weather patterns, sea levels, and a variety of ecosystems worldwide, often for the worse. 

Buddhist teachings about this concept of interconnectedness can help spread awareness that we are not isolated individuals, but rather part of a web. Our choices are innately tied to the well-being of others, both in the present and in the future. So in this case, when we use the concept of interconnectedness we can come to realize that it's not just an environmental issue -- it's a matter of social justice and having compassion for all beings.
