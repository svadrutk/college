Tupac and Biggie were both at the forefront of the hip-hop genre in the 1990s. However, both of them were beloved by so many for different reasons. 

Tupac was well-known for having songs that addressed social issues in inner cities. Being the son of two parents who were political activists as well as Black Panther Party members, Tupac was one of the pioneers of the conscious rap subgenre, which contains thought-provoking lyrics about controversial and complex issues. A song that illustrates this is "Changes", released in 1992. This song makes references to the treatment of African-Americans by the police, racism, the war on drugs, and more. This starts from the first verse -- "My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch / Cops give a damn about a negro / Pull the trigger, kill a n****, he's a hero". 

Meanwhile, The Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie, was well-known for his style of lyric delivery -- he delivered grim content in a distinctive, laid-back style. Biggie was rooted in East Coast gangsta rap as well as the rap feud between the two coasts -- his label, Bad Boy Records, versus Tupac's Death Row. However, I think the reason Biggie was so beloved was because he rapped about relatable subjects, about how he came from rags to riches. The best example of this is in "Juicy", one of the first songs of his to hit the mainstream. In the song, he flexes his newfound lifestyle and who he came from nothing -- "Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis / When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this / 50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa / Got two rides, a limousine with a chaffeur". Songs like this show the reason why Biggie got so popular -- even though he came from a background that a lot of people didn't relate to, the content of his songs makes sense; everybody loves a good rags-to-riches story.
