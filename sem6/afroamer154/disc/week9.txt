Two significant hip-hop scenes from the 1990s were the Atlanta and Houston scenes. Both scenes were pivotal in the evolution of Southern hip-hop, and influenced the genre as a whole. However, they had distinct characteristics that set the two scenes apart. 

Atlanta's hip-hop scene was characterized by its broad range of styles, combining funk, soul, and trap music. Atlanta-based artists utilized their Southern roots in their lyrics and beats, creating a sound that was both gritty and melodic at the same time. An example of this unique style is seen in OutKast, especially their 1994 album "Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik". This album showcased the unique blend of Southern culture and innovative production techniques. The album had live instrumentation in its production and contained elements from genres like soul and funk. Additionally, the album contained Southern slang in their lyrics, such as in the song of the same name: 

"So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gafflin' me / 'Cause sleep and you'll get served with some Southern hospitality"

Another artist that was instrumental to the ATL scene was the Goodie Mob, who were known for having socially conscious lyrics and soulful production. Their album "Soul Food" is now considered a classic of Southern hip-hop. For example, on one of their songs they talk about how fast food restaurants had poorly graded meat filled with antibiotics: 

"Fast food got me feeling sick / Them crackers think they slick / By trying to make this bullshit affordable / I thank the lord that my voice was recordable"

The Houston hip-hop scene, by contrast, had a distinct sound that was characterized by its slow tempo, a chopped/screwed production style, and heavy basslines. Contrary to Atlanta hip-hop, Houston's hip-hop was more focused on themes like street life and hustling. One of the most prominent figures from the Houston scene was DJ Screw, who popularized the chopped and screwed DJ technique which slowed down and remixed tracks to create a hypnotic, atmospheric sound. Another artist was the Geto Boys, who talked about topics like mental health and how it was affected from life on the streets. The song "Mind Playing Tricks on Me" talks about how the Geto Boys' life has caused them to become paranoid about everything, such as the lyric 

"Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window / Investigatin' the joint for traps / Checkin' my telephone for taps"

In conclusion, the Atlanta hip-hop scene had a more diverse range of sounds and influences, while Houston mainly focused on a chopped and screwed style. ATL artists explored a wider range of topics lyrically, while Houston's artists emphasized living on the streets and violence.
