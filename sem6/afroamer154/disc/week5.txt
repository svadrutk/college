Rakim and Eric B. were pivotal figures of hip-hop in the 80s, often called the Golden Age of hip-hop. 

Before Rakim, rappers used basic rhymes and deliveries. Rakim's background as a relative to jazz and opera artists allowed him to rhyme differently than any other rapper had before him. Rakim described the act of rhyming "as if it were a pitbull on a long leash, and undertwo pulling into a deep ocean of words, and, above all, a dangerous havit from which there was no return." (96). He was a saxophonist before he was a rapper, and as a result, he brought that style of music to his raps. Rakim's lyrics also dealt with social issues, self-awareness, and introspection. For Rakim, "hip hop represented a personal journey to freedom and anyone could choose to take that freedom wherever they wanted."

Rakim also pioneered the new subgenre of "concept rap", where songs explored a single theme. Examples of this can be seen in tracks like "Paid In Full" and "Eric B. is President". Additionally, his laid-back, conversational delivery was a huge contrast to the more aggressive styles of the time pioneered by MCs like Run-DMC and KRS-One -- according to rapper Kool Moe Dee, the concept of flow wasn't very widely used; "Rakim is basically the inventor of flow. We were not even using the word flow until Rakim came along...Rakim created flow!". 

Rakim's influence on hip-hop outside of simply the music was also quite large. Rakim's signature Kangol hat and athletic wear was a huge influence on hip-hop fashion, blurring the lines between streetwear and mainstream trends. 

Most of all, Rakim's (and Eric B.'s) legacy was huge. Rakim's flow helped set up East Coast hip-hop's reputation for innovative lyrical technique. From Nas and Jay-Z to Kendrick Lamar and Eminem, countless rappers have cited Rakim as one of their influences.
