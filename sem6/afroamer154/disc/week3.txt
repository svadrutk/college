Funk, the Black Power movement, and the disco each affected the world of 1970s Black music and culture. 

Funk was created in the 1960s in African-American communities as a potpourri of music genres popular in the African-American community at the time. James Brown was the main influence on a new type of music that emphasized the downbeat and made music more danceable. His lyrics were also responsible for a new form of Black expression -- songs like "Say It Loud -- I'm Black and I'm Proud" become anthems for Black empowerment. In fact, Chang says that when he performed the song, "his presence...prevented riots in racially tense Boston in the immediate aftermath of Martin Luther King, Jr's assassination."(77)

The Black Power movement also had a large effect on the world of 1970s Black music and culture. During the 1970s, the South Bronx decayed to the level of some bombed out cities after World War II due to Robert Moses's urban renewal project displacing thousands of residents. This led to gang violence, and a surge in the Black Power movement as African-Americans became enraged when they realized that no one would help them. This affected the music at the time as well -- Gil Scott-Heron released spoken-word pieces like "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" in 1971 to advocate for change. Additionally, the Black Power movement's ideals also influenced the aesthetics of album covers and stage performances, putting cultural symbols and Afrocentric imagery in the forefront. 

Finally, disco also had an effect on 1970s black music and culture. Disco was originally a genre that started out in LGBTQ+ and Black nightclubs and quickly became mainstream thanks to movies like "Saturday Night Fever", released in 1977 and starring John Travolta. Disco wasn't just a genre; it was a cultural movement, promoting inclusivity in and outside of the dance floor. Disco also emphasized the DJ as a central figure thanks to them mixing songs for parties.
